Removing a user from your Zero Trust Organization will free up the seat the user consumed. The user will still appear in your list of users.

To remove a user from your Zero Trust Organization:

1. In [Cloudflare One](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com), go to **Team & Resources** > **Users**.
2. Select the checkbox next to a user with an **Active** status in the **Seat usage** column.
3. Select **Action** > **Remove users**.
4. Select **Remove**.

The user will now show as **Inactive** and will no longer occupy a seat. If a user is removed but authenticates later, they will consume a seat again. To prevent a user from authenticating, you must remove them from your [device enrollment policies](/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/warp/deployment/device-enrollment/) or from your Identity Provider (IdP).

To automate the removal of users who have not logged in or triggered a device enrollment in a specific amount of time, turn on [seat expiration](/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/users/seat-management/#enable-seat-expiration) or utilize [SCIM](/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/users/scim/) to remove users when they are deactivated in your identity provider.

:::note[User record persistence]
You cannot delete or archive a user record. You can [remove a user](#remove-a-user) from a seat, but their user record will remain in your Zero Trust Organization. Inactive users do not count towards billing.

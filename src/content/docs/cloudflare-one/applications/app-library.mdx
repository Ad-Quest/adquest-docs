The Application Library allows users to manage their SaaS applications in Cloudflare Zero Trust by consolidating views across all relevant products: [Gateway](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/), [Access](/cloudflare-one/policies/access/), and [Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB)](/cloudflare-one/applications/casb/). The App Library provides visibility and control for available applications, as well as the ability to view categorized hostnames and manage configuration for Access for SaaS and Gateway policies. For example, you can use the App Library to review how Gateway uses specific hostnames to match against application traffic.

To access the App Library in [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/), go to **My team** > **App Library**. Each application card will list the number of hostnames associated with the application, the supported Zero Trust product usage, and the [app type](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/application-app-types/#app-types).

The App Library groups [Do Not Inspect applications](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/application-app-types/#do-not-inspect-applications) within the corresponding application. For example, the App Library will group _Google Drive (Do Not Inspect)_ under **Google Drive**. Traffic that does not match a known application will not be included in the App Library.

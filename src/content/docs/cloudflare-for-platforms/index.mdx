<Description>

Build a platform where your customers can deploy code, each with their own subdomain or custom domain.

</Description>

Cloudflare for Platforms is used by leading platforms big and small to:

- Build application development platforms tailored to specific domains, like ecommerce storefronts or mobile apps
- Power AI coding platforms that let anyone build and deploy software
- Customize product behavior by allowing any user to write a short code snippet
- Offer every customer their own isolated database
- Provide each customer with their own subdomain

## Deploy your own platform

Get a working platform running in minutes. Choose a template based on what you are building:

### Platform Starter Kit

[![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/cloudflare/templates/tree/main/worker-publisher-template)

An example of a platform where users can deploy code at scale. Each snippet becomes its own isolated Worker, served at `example.com/{app-name}`. Deploying this starter kit automatically configures Workers for Platforms with routing handled for you.

### AI vibe coding platform

[![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/cloudflare/vibesdk)

Build an [AI vibe coding platform](/reference-architecture/diagrams/ai/ai-vibe-coding-platform/) where users describe what they want and AI generates and deploys working applications. Best for: AI-powered app builders, code generation tools, or internal platforms that empower teams to build applications & prototypes.

[VibeSDK](https://github.com/cloudflare/vibesdk) handles AI code generation, code execution in secure sandboxes, live previews, and deployment at scale.

## Features

- **Isolation and multitenancy** — Each of your customers runs code in their own Worker, a [secure and isolated sandbox](/cloudflare-for-platforms/workers-for-platforms/reference/worker-isolation/).
- **Programmable routing, ingress, egress, and limits** — You write code that dispatches requests to your customers' code, and can control [ingress](/cloudflare-for-platforms/workers-for-platforms/configuration/dynamic-dispatch/), [egress](/cloudflare-for-platforms/workers-for-platforms/configuration/outbound-workers/), and set [per-customer limits](/cloudflare-for-platforms/workers-for-platforms/configuration/custom-limits/).
- **Databases and storage** — You can provide [databases, object storage, and more](/cloudflare-for-platforms/workers-for-platforms/configuration/bindings/) to your customers as APIs they can call directly, without API tokens, keys, or external dependencies.
- **Custom domains and subdomains** — You [call an API](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/domain-support/) to create custom subdomains or configure custom domains for each of your customers.

Use the GraphQL Analytics API to retrieve Magic Network Monitoring <GlossaryTooltip term="flow data">flow data</GlossaryTooltip>.

Before you begin, you must have an [API token](/analytics/graphql-api/getting-started/authentication/). For additional help getting started with GraphQL Analytics, refer to [GraphQL Analytics API](/analytics/graphql-api/).

### Obtain your Cloudflare Account ID

To construct a Magic Network Monitoring GraphQL query for an object, you need a Cloudflare Account ID.

1. Log in to the Cloudflare dashboard, and select your account.

<DashButton url="/?to=/:account/home" />

2. The URL in your browser's address bar should show `https://dash.cloudflare.com/` followed by a hex string. The hex string is your Cloudflare Account ID.

## Explore GraphQL schema with Magic Network Monitoring example

Run a test query to retrieve a five-minute sum of bits and packets for flows within five-minute intervals. Copy and paste the following code into GraphiQL.

For additional information about the Analytics schema, refer to [Explore the Analytics schema with GraphiQL](/analytics/graphql-api/getting-started/explore-graphql-schema/).

```graphql graphql-api-explorer
query MagicNetworkMonitoring($accountTag: string!, $start: Time, $end: Time) {
	viewer {
		accounts(filter: { accountTag: $accountTag }) {
			mnmFlowDataAdaptiveGroups(
				filter: { datetime_gt: $start, datetime_leq: $end }
				limit: 10
				orderBy: [datetimeFiveMinutes_DESC]
			) {
				sum {
					bits
					packets
				}
				dimensions {
					datetimeFiveMinutes
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

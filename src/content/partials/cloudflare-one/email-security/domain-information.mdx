When you configure your domain, the Cloudflare dashboard will display you the following fields:

- **Domain**: Domain name. Refer to [Manage domains](/cloudflare-one/email-security/setup/manage-domains/) to learn how to add, filter, and delete domains.
- **Configured method**: The deployment method you used to configure your domain. Depending on how you decided to configure Email security, the dashboard will display:
    - **MS Graph API**: Your current email provider is Microsoft 365, and Email security has been configured via the Microsoft Graph API. You do not need to change any MX record.
    - **BCC/Journaling**: You have chosen to set your email via BCC/Journaling. A copy of your email is sent to Cloudflare.
    - **MX/ Inline**: You have configured your email domain using MX/Inline. This configuration requires a [DNS record change](/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/create-dns-records/#edit-dns-records).
- **Status**: Status indicates the state of the configuration. 
    - For MX/Inline and BCC/Journaling, the dashboard will display **Active** if Email security has processed any email in the last seven days. The dashboard will display **No mail flow** if there has been no email activity in the last seven days. This is likely due to a misconfiguration. Refer to [Configuration checklist](/cloudflare-one/email-security/setup/#5-configuration-checklist) to ensure you have configured your environment correctly.
    - For MS Graph API, the dashboard will display **Active** if your integration has been successfully connected, and Email security can scan your inbox with the integration. The dashboard will display **Broken** if the API is not scanning emails. This could be due to a CASB misconfiguration. To troubleshoot this, refer to [Troubleshoot CASB](/cloudflare-one/cloud-and-saas-findings/troubleshoot-casb/).
- **Service address**: This is the email address you will use to send a copy of your email.
- **Source**: Depending on how you added the domains, the dashboard will display **MS integration**, **Google**, **CF zones**, or **Manual add**.
- **Integration name**: Name of the integration. This field will only be displayed for Microsoft integrations. To rename your integration:
    1. Log in to [Cloudflare One](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/) > **Integrations** > **Cloud & SaaS**.
    2. Locate your integration, select **Configure**, then select **Edit**.
    3. Rename your integration, then select **Save**. 
- **Hops**: The number of hops. This will not be displayed if the configuration method is Microsoft Graph API. Hop count will be visible only if it has been configured.
- **Date added**: Date when the domain was added.

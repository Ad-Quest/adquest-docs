Browser Isolation is not compatible with [self-hosted private applications](/cloudflare-one/access-controls/applications/non-http/self-hosted-private-app/) that use private IPs or hostnames on ports other than `443`. Trying to access self-hosted applications on non-`443` ports will result in a Gateway block page.

To use Browser Isolation for an application on a private IP address with a non-`443` port, configure a [private network application](/cloudflare-one/access-controls/applications/non-http/legacy-private-network-app/) instead.

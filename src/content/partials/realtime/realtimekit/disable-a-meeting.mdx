## Disable a meeting

Ending a session does not disable the meeting. Participants can join the meeting again and start a new session.
To prevent participants from joining again and starting a new session, set the meeting status to `INACTIVE` using the [Update a meeting](/api/resources/realtime_kit/subresources/meetings/methods/update_meeting_by_id/) API.

<APIRequest
	path="/accounts/{account_id}/realtime/kit/{app_id}/meetings/{meeting_id}"
	method="PATCH"
	json={{
		status: "INACTIVE",
	}}
/>

## When should I use a note/warning?

Use a note to alert a reader to additional useful information that you cannot integrate into the text.

Use a warning to alert a reader to behavior that could impact the security of a users network or break functionality.

## Recommendations

* **An aside should not contain too much content**, since it breaks the normal text flow. For example, up to 3 paragraphs or bulleted lists up to 3 items. If you need to include more content, consider creating a documentation section "Important notes" or similar.
* **Use asides sparingly.** Each section should not have more than one aside of the same type. The only exception is a possible availability disclaimer right after the heading.
* **Asides inside task step instructions should not have a header.** They take too much space and the background color is enough to distinguish the aside content from regular text.
* **Use a `note` aside to state the restricted availability of a feature** (for example, "Only available for customers on an Enterprise plan.") at the beginning of a page, without a header.

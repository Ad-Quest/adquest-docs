You must deploy a [user-side certificate](/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/user-side-certificates/) so that {props.os} devices managed by Intune can establish trust with Cloudflare when their traffic is inspected.

1. (Optional) Generate a [Cloudflare root certificate](/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/user-side-certificates/#generate-a-cloudflare-root-certificate).

2. In [Cloudflare One](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com), find and [download a root certificate](/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/user-side-certificates/manual-deployment/#download-a-cloudflare-root-certificate) in `.crt` format.

Network Analytics provides detailed analytics on your {props.productName} traffic over time. You can filter data by traffic characteristics and review traffic trends over time.

For details, refer to <a href={props.networkAnalyticsURL}>{props.productName} Network Analytics</a>.

## Traceroutes

Traceroutes provide a hop-by-hop breakdown of the Internet path network traffic follows from Cloudflare's network to your network.

For details, refer to <a href={props.traceRoutes}>Traceroutes</a>.

## Packet captures

Packet captures allow you to analyze the raw packet data your network sends to and receives from Cloudflare's network.

For details, refer to [packet captures](/magic-firewall/packet-captures/).

## Query analytics with GraphQL

GraphQL Analytics provides a GraphQL API to query raw JSON data for your {props.productName} traffic analytics. You can ingest this data into a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tool or another platform for further analysis.

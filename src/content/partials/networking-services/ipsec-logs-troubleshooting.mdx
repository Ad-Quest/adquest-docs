You can use IPsec logs to troubleshoot issues with your IPsec tunnels. This functionality targets the key-exchange portion of the IPsec handshake. Set up a logpush job to forward your IPsec logs to your preferred storage service, then investigate to find the root cause of key exchange issues.

## Set up an IPsec logpush job

1. Go to the **Logpush** page.

	<DashButton url="/?to=/:account/logs" />

2. Select **Create a Logpush job**.
3. Select **IPsec logs** as your dataset.

Refer to the [Logpush documentation](/logs/logpush/) for more information about features, including the [available fields](/logs/logpush/logpush-job/datasets/account/ipsec_logs/) in the dataset.

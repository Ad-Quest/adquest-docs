Since the Sandbox SDK is built on top of the [Containers](/containers/) platform, it shares the same underlying platform characteristics. Refer to these pages to understand how pricing and limits work for your sandbox deployments.

## Container limits

Refer to [Containers limits](/containers/platform-details/limits/) for complete details on:

- Memory, vCPU, and disk limits for concurrent container instances
- Instance types and their resource allocations
- Image size and storage limits

## Workers and Durable Objects limits

When using the Sandbox SDK from Workers or Durable Objects, you are subject to [Workers subrequest limits](/workers/platform/limits/#subrequests). By default, the SDK uses HTTP transport where each operation (`exec()`, `readFile()`, `writeFile()`, etc.) counts as one subrequest.

### Subrequest limits

- **Workers Free**: 50 subrequests per request
- **Workers Paid**: 1,000 subrequests per request

### Avoid subrequest limits with WebSocket transport

Enable WebSocket transport to multiplex all SDK calls over a single persistent connection:

<WranglerConfig>
```jsonc
{
	"vars": {
		"SANDBOX_TRANSPORT": "websocket"
	},
}
```
</WranglerConfig>

With WebSocket transport enabled:
- The WebSocket upgrade counts as one subrequest
- All subsequent SDK operations use the existing connection (no additional subrequests)
- Ideal for workflows with many SDK operations per request

See [Transport modes](/sandbox/configuration/transport/) for a complete guide.

## Best practices

To work within these limits:

- **Right-size your instances** - Choose the appropriate [instance type](/containers/platform-details/limits/#instance-types) based on your workload requirements
- **Clean up unused sandboxes** - Terminate sandbox sessions when they are no longer needed to free up resources
- **Optimize images** - Keep your [custom Dockerfiles](/sandbox/configuration/dockerfile/) lean to reduce image size
- **Use WebSocket transport for high-frequency operations** - Enable `SANDBOX_TRANSPORT=websocket` to avoid subrequest limits when making many SDK calls per request

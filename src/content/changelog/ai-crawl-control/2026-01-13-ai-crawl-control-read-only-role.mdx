Account administrators can now assign the **AI Crawl Control Read Only** role to provide read-only access to AI Crawl Control at the domain level.

Users with this role can view the **Overview**, **Crawlers**, **Metrics**, **Robots.txt**, and **Settings** tabs but cannot modify crawler actions or settings.

This role is specific for AI Crawl Control. You still require correct permissions to access other areas / features of the dashboard.

To assign, go to **Manage Account** > **Members** and add a policy with the **AI Crawl Control Read Only** role scoped to the desired domain.

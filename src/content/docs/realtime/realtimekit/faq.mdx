<Details header="How can I generate the Cloudflare API Token?">
To use RealtimeKit APIs, you must have a [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com).

Follow the [Create API token guide](/fundamentals/api/get-started/create-token/) to create a new token via the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens).
When configuring permissions, ensure that **Realtime** / **Realtime Admin** permissions are selected.
Configure any additional [access policies and restrictions](/fundamentals/api/reference/permissions/) as needed for your use case.

### Meetings 
<Details header="Can I schedule meetings in advance with RealtimeKit?">

While RealtimeKit does not include a built-in scheduling system, you can implement the scheduling experience on top of it in your application.
RealtimeKit meetings do not have start or end time, so your backend must store the schedule and enforce when users are allowed to join.
A common approach is:

- When a user schedules a meeting, your backend creates a meeting in RealtimeKit and stores the meeting `id` together with the start and end times.
- When a user tries to join the meeting in your application, your backend checks whether the current time is within the allowed window.
- If the checks pass, your backend [adds the participant](/api/resources/realtime_kit/subresources/meetings/methods/add_participant/) to the meeting,
  returns the participant auth token to the frontend and the frontend passes that token to the RealtimeKit SDK so the user can join.

</Details>

<Details header="How do I prevent participants from joining a meeting after a specific date or time?">
	You can disable the meeting at the required time by setting its status to `INACTIVE` using a `PATCH` request to the 
  [Update Meeting](/api/resources/realtime_kit/subresources/meetings/methods/update_meeting_by_id/) endpoint.

 This prevents participants from joining the meeting and prevents any new Sessions from starting.

   ```bash
curl https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{ACCOUNT_ID}/realtime/kit/{APP_ID}/meetings/{MEETING_ID} \
  --request PATCH \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer <CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN>" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{ "status": "INACTIVE" }'
```
</Details>

### Participants

<Details header="How do I generate an auth token for a participant?">
  Your backend generates an authentication token by adding the user as a participant to a meeting with the [Add Participant](/api/resources/realtime_kit/subresources/meetings/methods/add_participant/) API endpoint.
  The API response includes a `token` field, which is the authentication token for that participant in that meeting.
  
  If you need a new token for an existing participant after the previous token has expired, use the [Refresh Participant Token](/api/resources/realtime_kit/subresources/meetings/methods/refresh_participant_token/) endpoint.
  
  For more details, see [Participant tokens](/realtime/realtimekit/concepts/participant/#participant-tokens).
</Details>

<Details header="Can the same user join from multiple devices or browser tabs?">
	Yes. A single participant can be represented by multiple peers if the user
	joins the same meeting from different devices or tabs. Each connection becomes
	a separate peer, but they all map back to the same participant.
</Details>

<Details header="How can I prevent a user from joining a meeting again?">
	Delete that user's participant for the meeting using the [Delete
	Participant](/api/resources/realtime_kit/subresources/meetings/methods/delete_meeting_participant/)
	API endpoint. 

  Once the participant is deleted and you stop issuing new tokens for them, they will no longer be able to join that meeting.
</Details>

<Details header="Can the same participant join multiple sessions of a meeting?">
	Yes. As long as the participant exists for that meeting and has a valid
	authentication token, that participant can join multiple live sessions of the
	same meeting over time.
</Details>

<Details header="Do I need to create a new participant for every session?">
	In most cases, no. You typically create a participant once for a given user
	and meeting, and then reuse that participant across sessions of that meeting.
	You may need to refresh the participant’s authentication token over time, but
	you do not need to recreate the participant.
</Details>

<Details header="What should I use for custom_participant_id?">
	Use a stable internal identifier from your own system, such as a numeric user
	id or UUID. Do not use personal data such as email addresses, phone numbers,
	or other personally identifiable information.
</Details>

### Presets

<Details header="Do I need a new preset for every meeting or participant?">
Presets are **re-usable** set of rules and configurations that are defined at the App level. You can use the same preset for multiple participants.

 
Read more about presets [here](/realtime/realtimekit/concepts/preset/).
</Details>

### Client Side SDKs
<Details header="How do I decide which SDK to select?">
	RealtimeKit support all the popular frameworks for web and mobile platforms.

  We **recommend using our UI Kits** For most use cases.
  
  Please Note: When you use our UI Kit, you also get the core SDK with it, which can be used to build additional features based on your needs.

  For more information please refer to our [SDK Selection Guide](/realtime/realtimekit/sdk-selection/)

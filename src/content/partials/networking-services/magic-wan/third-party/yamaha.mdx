This tutorial describes how to configure the Yamaha RTX840 and RTX1300 series router to connect to Cloudflare Magic WAN via IPsec tunnels.

## Testing environment

These configurations were tested on the Yamaha RTX840 and RTX1300 series with the following firmware versions:

- **RTX840 series**: 23.02.02
- **RTX1300 series**: 23.00.17

## Magic WAN configuration

You need to add IPsec tunnels and static routes to your Cloudflare account via the Cloudflare dashboard.

Before proceeding, ensure that you have the anycast IPs associated with your account. Check with your Cloudflare account team if you do not yet have them.

### Magic IPsec tunnels

1. Follow the <a href={props.addTunnelsUrl}>Add tunnels</a> instructions to create the required IPsec tunnel. When creating your IPsec tunnel, make sure you define the following settings:
	- **Tunnel name**: Enter your tunnel name. In this example, it is `RTX840-vpn01`.
	- **Interface address**: Enter the internal tunnel IP on the Cloudflare side of the IPsec tunnel. In this example, it is `172.30.223.2/31`.
	- **Customer endpoint**: Enter the WAN IP address of your RTX router. In our example, this is `194.xx.xx.xx`. This is the fixed public IPv4 address you get from your ISP for your internet service.
	- **Cloudflare endpoint**: The Cloudflare anycast IP assigned to you by your account team.
	- **Health check rate**: _Medium_.
	- **Health check type**: _Request_.
	- **Health check direction**: _Bidirectional_.
	- **Health check target**: _Default_.
	- **Pre-shared key**: Select **Use my own pre-shared key** and paste a secure key of your own.
	- **Replay protection**: Do not check the box, to keep this disabled.

2. After you create your tunnel, the Cloudflare dashboard will load a list of tunnels set up for your account. Select the IPsec tunnel you have just created, and check the following setting:
	- **FQDN ID**: Copy this ID and save it. You will need it when configuring the IPsec tunnel on your RTX router.

### Magic static routes

Static routes are required for any networks that will be reached via the IPsec tunnel. In our example, there is one network: `172.16.2.0/24`.

Follow the <a href={props.configureStaticRoutesUrl}>Configure static routes</a> instructions to create a static route (settings not mentioned here can be left with their default values):

- **Description**: `RTX840-lan01`
- **Prefix**: `172.16.2.0/24`
- **Tunnel/Next hop**: _RTX840-vpn01_

## RTX router configuration

Use the CLI to configure these settings.

### Route settings

```txt
ip route default gateway tunnel 1

ip route <Cloudflare Anycast IP> gateway <ISP provided Gateway IP>

ip route < ISP's DNS server IP > gateway <ISP provided Gateway IP>
```

### LAN settings

```txt
ip lan1 address 172.16.2.254/24
```

### Wired WAN settings

```txt
ip lan2 address 194.xx.xx.xx/29

ip lan2 nat descriptor 1000
```

### IPsec VPN main side settings

```txt
tunnel select 1

ipsec tunnel 1

ipsec sa policy 1 1 esp aes256-cbc sha256-hmac anti-replay-check=off

ipsec ike version 1 2

ipsec ike duration ipsec-sa 1 3600

ipsec ike duration isakmp-sa 1 28800

ipsec ike encryption 1 aes256-cbc

ipsec ike group 1 modp2048

ipsec ike hash 1 sha256

ipsec ike keepalive log 1 off

ipsec ike keepalive use 1 on rfc4306 10 6

ipsec ike local address 1 194.xx.xx.xx

ipsec ike log 1 key-info message-info payload-info

ipsec ike local name 1 <Cloudflare Magic IPsec Tunnel FQDN IP> fqdn

ipsec ike pfs 1 on

ipsec ike proposal-limitation 1 on

ipsec ike pre-shared-key 1 text <Pre-shared key>

ipsec ike remote address 1 <Cloudflare Anycast IP>

ipsec ike remote name 1 <Cloudflare Anycast IP> ipv4-addr

ip tunnel address 172.30.223.3/31

ip tunnel tcp mss limit auto

tunnel enable 1

ipsec auto refresh on

! Note: 172.30.223.3/31 is internal tunnel IP on the RTX side.
```

### NAT settings

```txt
nat descriptor type 1000 masquerade

nat descriptor address outer 1000 primary

nat descriptor masquerade static 1000 1 194.xx.xx.xx udp 500

nat descriptor masquerade static 1000 2 194.xx.xx.xx esp
```

### DHCP settings

```txt
dhcp service server

dhcp server rfc2131 compliant except remain-silent

dhcp scope 1 172.16.2.2-172.16.2.191/24
```

### DNS settings

```txt
dns host lan1

dns server select 1 <ISP's DNS server IP> any .

dns private address spoof on
```

## Connection test

In the Yamaha RTX router CLI, you can run `show ipsec sa` and `show status tunnel` to check the status of the IPsec VPN.

### `show ipsec sa`

```txt
Total: isakmp:1 send:1 recv:1

sa    sgw   isakmp        connection    	dir 	 life[s] 	           remote-id

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2     1         1    		 tun[0001]esp  send 	 2185           （Cloudflare Anycast IP）

3     1         1    		 tun[0001]esp  recv 	 2185           （Cloudflare Anycast IP）
```

### `show status tunnel 1`

```txt

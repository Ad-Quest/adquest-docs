To add a published application when creating a new tunnel:

1. Go to the **Published applications** tab.

2. Enter a subdomain and select a **Domain** from the drop-down menu. Specify any subdomain or path information.
	:::note
	If you add a multi-level subdomain (more than one level of subdomain), you must [order an Advanced Certificate for the hostname](/cloudflare-one/faq/troubleshooting/#i-see-this-site-cant-provide-a-secure-connection).
	:::

3. Under **Service**, choose a [service type](/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/routing-to-tunnel/protocols/) and specify its URL. For example,
	- **Type**: _HTTP_
	- **URL**: `localhost:8000`

4. Under **Additional application settings**, specify any [parameters](/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/configure-tunnels/cloudflared-parameters/origin-parameters/) you would like to add to your tunnel configuration.

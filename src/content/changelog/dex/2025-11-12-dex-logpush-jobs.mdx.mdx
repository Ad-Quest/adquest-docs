[Digital Experience Monitoring (DEX)](/cloudflare-one/insights/dex/) provides visibility into WARP device metrics, connectivity, and network performance across your Cloudflare SASE deployment.

We've released four new WARP and DEX device data sets that can be exported via [Cloudflare Logpush](/cloudflare-one/insights/logs/logpush/). These Logpush data sets can be exported to R2, a cloud bucket, or a SIEM to build a customized logging and analytics experience. 

1. [DEX Application Tests](/logs/logpush/logpush-job/datasets/account/dex_application_tests/)
2. [DEX Device State Events](/logs/logpush/logpush-job/datasets/account/dex_device_state_events/)
3. [WARP Config Changes](/logs/logpush/logpush-job/datasets/account/warp_config_changes/)
4. [WARP Toggle Changes](/logs/logpush/logpush-job/datasets/account/warp_toggle_changes/)

To create a new DEX or WARP Logpush job, customers can go to the account level of the Cloudflare dashboard > Analytics & Logs > Logpush to get started.

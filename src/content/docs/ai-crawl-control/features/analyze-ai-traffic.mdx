## View the Metrics tab

The **Metrics** tab provides detailed analytics and charts to help you understand how AI crawlers are interacting with your website.

### Requests over time

Visualize crawler activity patterns over the selected time period. Use the view selector to switch between metrics:

| View                 | Description                                                                       |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **All requests**     | Total requests including blocked and error responses.                             |
| **Allowed requests** | Requests that received a successful response (status 200-299).                    |
| **Data transfer**    | Bandwidth consumption for allowed requests over time, formatted as KB, MB, or GB. |

You can group the data by different dimensions:

| Dimension    | Description                                                                              |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Crawler**  | Track activity from individual AI crawlers (such as GPTBot, ClaudeBot, Bytespider).      |
| **Category** | Analyze crawlers by their purpose or type.                                               |
| **Operator** | Discover which companies (such as OpenAI, Anthropic, ByteDance) are crawling your site.  |
| **Host**     | Break down activity across multiple subdomains.                                          |

:::note
The Data transfer view shows `edgeResponseBytes`. Some crawlers may show higher data transfer per request than others, depending on the content they request.
:::

### Status code distribution

The **Status code distribution** chart shows HTTP response codes for AI crawler requests over time:

- **2xx** — Successful responses
- **3xx** — Redirects
- **4xx** — Client errors (including 403 blocked and 402 payment required)
- **5xx** — Server errors

Use this chart to identify patterns in how your site responds to AI crawlers, including the distribution of error codes and the volume of redirects.

### Top referrers

:::note
This feature is available for customers on a paid plan.
:::

Identify traffic sources with referrer analytics to understand discovery patterns and content popularity from AI operators.

| View                     | Description                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Referral sources**     | Top domains sending AI-driven referral traffic to your site (for example, `chatgpt.com`, `perplexity.ai`).           |
| **Destination patterns** | Which site areas receive the most AI-driven referral traffic, grouped by pattern (for example, `/blog/*`, `/api/*`). |

Toggle between views using the tabs in the Top referrers section.

### Referrals over time

Track referral traffic trends over your selected time period. Group by:

| Dimension    | Description                                                                |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Operator** | Stacked area chart showing referrals by company (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.). |
| **Source**   | Top referral URLs driving traffic.                                         |
| **Total**    | Aggregate referral volume.                                                 |

### Most popular paths

The **Most popular paths** table shows which pages on your site are most frequently requested by AI crawlers.

| Column               | Description                                               |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Path**             | The page path that was requested.                         |
| **Hostname**         | The hostname of the requested page.                       |
| **Referrals**        | Number of referral visits to this path from AI platforms. |
| **Allowed requests** | Number of successful requests to this path.               |

To see a breakdown by crawler per path, use the top-level filters.

#### Analyze site areas with pattern grouping

Select the **Patterns** tab to see requests grouped by URI pattern (such as `/blog/*`, `/api/v1/*`, or `/docs/*`). This helps you quickly identify which areas of your site AI crawlers target most.

Pattern grouping aggregates individual paths into site areas:

- Patterns include up to 2 levels of depth (for example, `/api/*`, `/api/v1/*`)
- The root pattern `/*` shows total traffic across your site
- Patterns are not aggregated across hostnames
- Single-path patterns display without wildcards (for example, `sitemap.xml` instead of `sitemap.xml/*`)

Additional tabs include:

- **All** — Combined content and media requests (individual paths, not patterns)
- **Content** — HTML, JSON, and text content
- **Media** — Images, videos, and other media files

## Filter and export data

Use the filter bar to narrow your analysis by multiple criteria:

| Filter         | Description                               |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Date range** | Select the time period to analyze.        |
| **Crawler**    | Filter to specific AI crawlers.           |
| **Operator**   | Filter to specific companies.             |
| **Hostname**   | Filter to specific subdomains.            |
| **Path**       | Filter to specific URL paths or patterns. |

Combine multiple filters for complex analysis. All metrics and charts update dynamically based on your filter selection.

To export your data, select **Download CSV** or **Download image**. Downloads include all applied filters and groupings.

## Per-crawler drilldowns

The **Crawlers** tab includes an actions menu for each crawler with the following options:

| Action                         | Description                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **View Metrics**               | Filter the **Metrics** tab to the selected crawler.                                                                                       |

## Requirements

AMP Real URL is available for all plans. However, refer to the following requirements before enabling this feature:

* AMP Real URL relies on signed exchanges so all [requirements for signed exchanges must be met](/speed/optimization/other/signed-exchanges/enable-signed-exchange/).
* The origin server [must support AMP responses](https://amp.dev/about/how-amp-works/).

## Enable AMP Real URL

If your account satisfies the requirements to enable AMP Real URL:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Settings** page.

   <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/:zone/speed/optimization" />

2. Go to **Other**.
3. Scroll to **AMP Real URL** and toggle the button to enable it.

## Limitations

Since AMP Real URL responses are packaged in a signed exchange (SXG), the [limitations for SXGs apply](/speed/optimization/other/signed-exchanges/signed-exchanges-caveats/).

You can now achieve higher cache hit rates and reduce origin load when using [Load Balancing](/load-balancing/) with [Smart Tiered Cache](/cache/how-to/tiered-cache/). Cloudflare automatically selects a single, optimal tiered data center for all origins in your Load Balancing Pool.

## How it works

When you use [Load Balancing](/load-balancing/) with [Smart Tiered Cache](/cache/how-to/tiered-cache/), Cloudflare analyzes performance metrics across your pool's origins and automatically selects the optimal Upper Tier data center for the entire pool. This means:

- **Consistent cache location**: All origins in the pool share the same Upper Tier cache.
- **Higher HIT rates**: Requests for the same content hit the cache more frequently.
- **Reduced origin requests**: Fewer requests reach your origin servers.
- **Improved performance**: Faster response times for cache HITs.

## Example workflow

```txt
Load Balancing Pool: api-pool
├── Origin 1: api-1.example.com
├── Origin 2: api-2.example.com
└── Origin 3: api-3.example.com
    ↓
Selected Upper Tier: [Optimal data center based on pool performance]
```

## Get started

To get started, enable [Smart Tiered Cache](/cache/how-to/tiered-cache/) on your zone and configure your [Load Balancing Pool](/load-balancing/).

import { RuleID } from "~/components";

The WAF rule deployed yesterday to block unsafe deserialization-based RCE has been updated. The rule description now reads “React – RCE – CVE-2025-55182”, explicitly mapping to the recently disclosed React Server Components vulnerability. Detection logic remains unchanged.

**Key Findings**

Rule description updated to reference React – RCE – CVE-2025-55182 while retaining existing unsafe-deserialization detection.

**Impact**

Improved classification and traceability with no change to coverage against remote code execution attempts.

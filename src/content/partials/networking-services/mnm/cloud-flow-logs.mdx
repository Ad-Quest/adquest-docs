Customers using Magic Network Monitoring can export virtual private cloud (VPC) flow logs from their cloud environment to Cloudflare's network. Cloudflare processes these logs and displays analytics on your cloud traffic in the dashboard. You can also ingest data on your cloud traffic via our public [GraphQL API](/analytics/graphql-api/), which powers the cloud traffic analytics in the Cloudflare dashboard.

Currently, Magic Network Monitoring only supports AWS VPC flow logs via AWS Firehose. You can only configure AWS flow logs via the Magic Network Monitoring API.

To learn how to set up AWS VPC flow logs, refer to [Set up AWS VPC flow logs](/magic-network-monitoring/get-started/#vpc-flow-log-guide).

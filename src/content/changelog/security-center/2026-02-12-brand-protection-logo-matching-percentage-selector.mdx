We have significantly upgraded our Logo Matching capabilities within Brand Protection. While previously limited to approximately 100% matches, users can now detect a wider range of brand assets through a redesigned matching model and UI.

### What's new

- **Configurable match thresholds**: Users can set a minimum match score (starting at 75%) when creating a logo query to capture subtle variations or high-quality impersonations.
- **Visual match scores**: Allow users to see the exact percentage of the match directly in the results table, highlighted with color-coded lozenges to indicate severity.
- **Direct logo previews**: Available in the Cloudflare dashboard — similar to string matches — to verify infringements at a glance.

### Key benefits

- **Expose sophisticated impersonators** who use slightly altered logos to bypass basic detection filters.
- **Faster triage** of the most relevant threats immediately using visual indicators, reducing the time spent manually reviewing matches.

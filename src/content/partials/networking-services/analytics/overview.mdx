Network Analytics provides detailed analytics on your {props.productName} traffic over time. You can filter data by traffic characteristics and review traffic trends over time.

Refer to <a href={props.networkAnalyticsURL}>{props.productName} Network Analytics</a> to learn more.

## Traceroutes

Traceroutes provide a hop-by-hop breakdown of the Internet path that network traffic follows from Cloudflare's network to your network.

Refer to <a href={props.traceRoutes}>Traceroutes</a> to learn more.

## Packet captures

Packet captures allow you to analyze the raw packet data your network sends to and receives from Cloudflare's network.

Refer to [packet captures](/magic-firewall/packet-captures/) to learn more.

## Query analytics with GraphQL

GraphQL Analytics provides a GraphQL API you can query to receive raw JSON data for your {props.productName} traffic analytics. You can ingest this data into a security information and event management (SIEM) tool or another platform for further analysis.

Cloudflare [admin activity logs](/cloudflare-one/insights/logs/) now capture each time a [DNS over HTTP (DoH) user](/cloudflare-one/networks/resolvers-and-proxies/dns/dns-over-https/) is created.

These logs can be viewed from the [Cloudflare One dashboard](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/), pulled via the [Cloudflare API](/api/), and exported through [Logpush](/cloudflare-one/insights/logs/logpush/).

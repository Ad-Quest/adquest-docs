We have updated the Monitoring page to provide a more streamlined and insightful experience for administrators, improving both data visualization and dashboard accessibility.

* **Enhanced Visual Layout**: Optimized contrast and the introduction of stacked bar charts for clearer data visualization and trend analysis.

    * **Widget Search**: Added search functionality to multiple widgets, including Policies, Submitters, and Impersonation. 
    * **Actionable UI**: All available actions are now accessible via dedicated buttons. 
    * **State Indicators**: Improved UI states to clearly communicate loading, empty datasets, and error conditions.

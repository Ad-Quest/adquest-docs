Email security offers multiple deployment models:

- API for Microsoft 365 users.
- BCC for Google Workspace users.
- MX/Inline for all email providers.

When you choose the [API deployment](/cloudflare-one/email-security/setup/post-delivery-deployment/api/), Email security can both scan and take actions on emails after they have reached a user's inbox.

If you are a Google Workspace user, you can enable Email security via [BCC setup](/cloudflare-one/email-security/setup/post-delivery-deployment/bcc-journaling/bcc-setup/gmail-bcc-setup/gmail-bcc-setup/). Email security scans a copy of your email after it lands in your inbox.

With MX/Inline, Email security scans your email before they land in your inbox, giving you the highest level of protection.

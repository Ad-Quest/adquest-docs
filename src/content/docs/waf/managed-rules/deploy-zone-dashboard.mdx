The instructions in this page provide general guidance for deploying and configuring a managed ruleset for a zone.

For more specific instructions, refer to the following pages:

- [Deploy the Cloudflare Managed Ruleset](/waf/managed-rules/reference/cloudflare-managed-ruleset/#deploy-in-the-dashboard)
- [Deploy the Cloudflare OWASP Core Ruleset](/waf/managed-rules/reference/owasp-core-ruleset/configure-dashboard/#deploy-in-the-dashboard)
- [Deploy the Cloudflare Sensitive Data Detection ruleset](/waf/managed-rules/reference/sensitive-data-detection/#deploy-in-the-dashboard)

:::tip
To deploy a managed ruleset for several Enterprise domains in your account, refer to [Deploy a managed ruleset in the dashboard for an account](/waf/account/managed-rulesets/deploy-dashboard/).

## Deploy a managed ruleset

To deploy a managed ruleset for a zone:

<Render file="dash-deploy-managed-ruleset-zone" product="waf" />

To temporarily turn off a managed ruleset without deleting its deployment configuration, use the toggle next to the rule that deploys the managed ruleset.

## Configure a managed ruleset

Configure a managed ruleset to:

- Specify a custom filter expression to apply the rules in the ruleset to a subset of incoming requests.
- Configure (or override) specific settings for one or more rules (for example, configure a rule with an action different from the default action configured by Cloudflare), or turn off those rules.

To skip one or more rules — or even entire managed rulesets — for specific incoming requests, [add an exception](/waf/managed-rules/waf-exceptions/).

:::note
Some managed rulesets may not allow custom configuration, depending on your Cloudflare plan.

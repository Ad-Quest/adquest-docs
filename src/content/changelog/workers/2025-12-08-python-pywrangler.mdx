We are introducing a brand new tool called Pywrangler, which simplifies package management in Python Workers by
automatically installing Workers-compatible Python packages into your project.

With Pywrangler, you specify your Worker's Python dependencies in your `pyproject.toml` file:

```toml
[project]
name = "python-beautifulsoup-worker"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "A simple Worker using beautifulsoup4"
requires-python = ">=3.12"
dependencies = [
    "beautifulsoup4"
]

[dependency-groups]
dev = [
  "workers-py",
  "workers-runtime-sdk"
]
```

You can then develop and deploy your Worker using the following commands:

```bash
uv run pywrangler dev
uv run pywrangler deploy
```

Pywrangler automatically downloads and vendors the necessary packages for your Worker, and these packages are bundled with the Worker when you deploy.


Consult the [Python packages documentation](/workers/languages/python/packages/) for full details on Pywrangler and Python package management in Workers.

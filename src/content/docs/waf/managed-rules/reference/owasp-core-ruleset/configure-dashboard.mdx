The Cloudflare OWASP Core Ruleset is Cloudflare's implementation of the [OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set](https://owasp.org/www-project-modsecurity-core-rule-set/) (CRS). It is designed to work as a single entity to calculate a [threat score](/waf/managed-rules/reference/owasp-core-ruleset/concepts/#request-threat-score) and execute an action based on that score.

## Deploy the Cloudflare OWASP Core Ruleset {/* deploy-in-the-dashboard */}

<Render
	file="dash-deploy-managed-ruleset-zone"
	product="waf"
	params={{
		rulesetName: "Cloudflare OWASP Core Ruleset",
		dashOptionName: "OWASP core ruleset",
	}}
/>

## Configure in the dashboard

You can configure (or override) the Cloudflare OWASP Core Ruleset, overriding its default configuration, at several levels:

- [Ruleset level](#ruleset-level-configuration)
- [Tag level](#tag-level-configuration)
- [Rule level](#rule-level-configuration)

More specific configurations (rule and tag level) have greater priority than less specific configurations (ruleset level).

### Ruleset-level configuration

You can configure (or override) the following Cloudflare OWASP Core Ruleset settings in the Cloudflare dashboard:

- **Scope**: When you specify a custom filter expression, the Cloudflare OWASP Core Ruleset applies only to a subset of the incoming requests. By default, a managed ruleset deployed in the dashboard applies to all incoming traffic.
- **[Paranoia level](/waf/managed-rules/reference/owasp-core-ruleset/concepts/#paranoia-level)**: The paranoia level (PL) classifies OWASP rules according to their aggressiveness, varying from _PL1_ to _PL4_, where _PL4_ is the most strict level. The available levels are:
  - _PL1_ (default)
  - _PL2_
  - _PL3_
  - _PL4_
- **[Score threshold](/waf/managed-rules/reference/owasp-core-ruleset/concepts/#score-threshold)**: The score threshold (or anomaly threshold) defines the minimum cumulative score — obtained from matching OWASP rules — for the WAF to apply the configured OWASP ruleset action. The available thresholds are:
  - _Low - 60 and higher_
  - _Medium - 40 and higher_ (default)
  - _High - 25 and higher_
- **OWASP action**: The action to perform when the calculated [request threat score](/waf/managed-rules/reference/owasp-core-ruleset/concepts/#request-threat-score) is greater than the [score threshold](/waf/managed-rules/reference/owasp-core-ruleset/concepts/#score-threshold). The available actions are: _Managed Challenge_, _Block_, _JS Challenge_, _Interactive Challenge_, and _Log_.
- **[Payload logging](/waf/managed-rules/payload-logging/configure/)**: When enabled, logs the request information (payload) that triggered a specific rule of the managed ruleset. You must configure a public key to encrypt the payload.

Once you have [deployed the Cloudflare OWASP Core Ruleset](#deploy-in-the-dashboard), do the following to configure it in the dashboard:

<Render
	file="dash-configure-all-rules"
	params={{
		rulesetName: "Cloudflare OWASP Core Ruleset",
	}}
	product="waf"
/>

### Tag-level configuration

You can configure (or override) the following setting in the dashboard for OWASP Core Ruleset rules tagged with at least one of the selected tags:

- **Rule status**: Sets the rule status (enabled or disabled) for all the rules with the selected tags. To remove the action override at the tag level, set the action to _Default_.

:::note
Setting the rule status for specific tags affects all current and future rules with the tags you selected.
:::

Once you have [deployed the Cloudflare OWASP Core Ruleset](#deploy-in-the-dashboard), do the following to configure rules with specific tags in the dashboard:

<Render
	file="dash-configure-rules-by-tag"
	product="waf"
	params={{
		rulesetName: "Cloudflare OWASP Core Ruleset",
	}}
/>

### Rule-level configuration

You can configure (or override) the following setting in the dashboard for the selected OWASP Core Ruleset rules:

- **Rule status**: Sets the status (enabled or disabled) of a single rule or, if you select multiple rules, for the selected rules.

Once you have [deployed the Cloudflare OWASP Core Ruleset](#deploy-in-the-dashboard), do the following to configure individual ruleset rules in the dashboard:

<Tabs syncKey="dashNewNav"> <TabItem label="New dashboard" icon="rocket">

<Render
	file="managed-rules-browse-zone-new-nav"
	product="waf"
	params={{
		rulesetName: "Cloudflare OWASP Core Ruleset",
	}}
/>

<Render
	file="managed-ruleset-configure-individual-rules"
	product="waf"
	params={{
		rulesetName: "Cloudflare OWASP Core Ruleset",
	}}
/>

</TabItem> <TabItem label="Old dashboard">

<Render
	file="managed-rules-browse-zone"
	product="waf"
	params={{
		rulesetName: "Cloudflare OWASP Core Ruleset",
	}}
/>

<Render
	file="managed-ruleset-configure-individual-rules"
	product="waf"
	params={{
		rulesetName: "Cloudflare OWASP Core Ruleset",
	}}
/>

</TabItem> </Tabs>

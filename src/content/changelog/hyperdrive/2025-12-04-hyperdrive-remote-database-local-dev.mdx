You can now connect directly to remote databases and databases requiring TLS with `wrangler dev`.
This lets you run your Worker code locally while connecting to remote databases, without needing to use `wrangler dev --remote`.

The `localConnectionString` field and `CLOUDFLARE_HYPERDRIVE_LOCAL_CONNECTION_STRING_<BINDING_NAME>` environment variable can be used to configure the connection string used by `wrangler dev`.

```jsonc
{
  "hyperdrive": [
    {
      "binding": "HYPERDRIVE",
      "id": "your-hyperdrive-id",
      "localConnectionString": "postgres://user:password@remote-host.example.com:5432/database?sslmode=require"
    }
  ]
}
```

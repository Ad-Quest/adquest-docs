<Description>

Build your own multitenant platform using Cloudflare as infrastructure

</Description>

Cloudflare for Platforms lets you run untrusted code written by your customers, or by AI, in a secure, hosted sandbox, and give each customer their own subdomain or custom domain.

## Who is Cloudflare for Platforms for?

Cloudflare for Platforms is designed for teams building products where end users need to run code, store data, or get their own domain. Common use cases include:

- **AI coding platforms** — Let users describe apps in natural language, generate code with AI, and deploy instantly
- **E-commerce and website builders** — Power storefronts where merchants customize behavior, add integrations, or write their own logic
- **Low-code / no-code platforms** — Let non-developers build and deploy applications without managing infrastructure
- **Developer tools and SaaS products** — Allow customers to extend your product with custom scripts, webhooks, or plugins

### Platform Capabilities

You can think of Cloudflare for Platforms as the exact same products and functionality that Cloudflare offers its own customers, structured so that you can offer it to your own customers, embedded within your own product. This includes:

- **Custom Domains and Subdomains** — you [call an API](/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/) to create custom subdomains or configure custom domains for each of your customers
- **Isolation and multitenancy** — each of your customers runs code in their own Worker — a [secure and isolated sandbox](/workers/reference/how-workers-works/)
- **Programmable routing, ingress, egress and limits** — you write code that dispatches requests to your customers' code, and can control [ingress](/cloudflare-for-platforms/workers-for-platforms/get-started/dynamic-dispatch/), [egress](/cloudflare-for-platforms/workers-for-platforms/configuration/outbound-workers/) and set [per-customer limits](/cloudflare-for-platforms/workers-for-platforms/configuration/custom-limits/)
- **Databases and storage** — you can provide [databases, object storage and more](/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/) to your customers as APIs they can call directly, without API tokens, keys, or external dependencies
- **Infinite scale** — Deploy millions of applications, domains, and resources (e.g. [databases](/d1/)) without managing infrastructure. Cloudflare automatically scales with your platform.

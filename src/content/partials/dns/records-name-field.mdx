- **Name**: A subdomain or the zone apex (`@`).
	- The name must be composed of labels of 63 characters or less (`label1.label2.label3`), where the fully qualified domain name (`label1.label2.label3.example.com`) does not exceed 253 characters.
	- DNS labels can contain any octet (byte value). However, for compatibility with hostnames and TLS certificates, it is recommended to use only letters, digits, and hyphens (LDH rule). This is not a DNS protocol requirement, meaning DNS will work even if you do not follow these conventions.
	- There is no requirement to start with a letter or end with a letter or digit.
	- Underscores are valid in DNS and commonly used for service records.

title: Better local deployment flow for Cloudflare Workers
description: Wrangler now provides a better user experience when deploying a worker that was previously deployed via the Cloudflare dashboard.

import { Example } from "~/components";

Until now, if a Worker had been previously deployed via the [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com), a subsequent deployment done via the Cloudflare Workers CLI, [**Wrangler**](/workers/wrangler/)
(through the [`deploy` command](/workers/wrangler/commands/#deploy)), would allow the user to override the Worker's dashboard settings without providing details on
what dashboard settings would be lost.

Now instead, `wrangler deploy` presents a helpful representation of the differences between the [local configuration](/workers/wrangler/configuration/)
and the remote dashboard settings, and offers to update your local configuration file for you.

See example below showing a before and after for `wrangler deploy` when a local configuration is expected to override a Worker's dashboard settings:

<Example title="Before">

![`wrangler deploy` run before the improved workflow](src/assets/images/changelog/workers/wrangler-deploy-remote-conflict-managemenet/before.png)

</Example>

<Example title="After">

![`wrangler deploy` run after the improved workflow](src/assets/images/changelog/workers/wrangler-deploy-remote-conflict-managemenet/after.png)

</Example>

Also, if instead Wrangler detects that a deployment would override remote dashboard settings but in an additive way, without modifying or removing any of them, it will simply proceed with the deployment without requesting any user interaction.

Update to [Wrangler](/workers/wrangler/) v4.50.0 or greater to take advantage of this improved deploy flow.

## Additional	records after import

You find several unexpected DNS records after adding your domain to Cloudflare.

### Cause

A wildcard (`*`) record at your previous authoritative DNS provider may have been imported into Cloudflare in a way that creates additional records.

### Solution

To solve this issue, you can do one of the following:

- [Delete records in bulk](/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/batch-record-changes/#delete-records-in-bulk).

- Remove and re-add your domain:

   1. [Remove your domain](/fundamentals/manage-domains/remove-domain/) from Cloudflare.
   2. Delete the wildcard record from your authoritative DNS.
   3. [Re-add](/fundamentals/manage-domains/add-site/) the domain.

## acme_challenge TXT records

You might notice TXT records like `_acme-challenge.<hostname>` are returned by your domain but cannot be found on the DNS tab of your Cloudflare dashboard.

### Cause

These records are automatically created to allow Cloudflare edge certificates ([universal](/ssl/edge-certificates/universal-ssl/), [advanced](/ssl/edge-certificates/advanced-certificate-manager/), and [backup](/ssl/edge-certificates/backup-certificates/)) to be provisioned. `_acme-challenge` records are required by <GlossaryTooltip term="Certificate Authority (CA)">certificate authorities (CAs)</GlossaryTooltip> so that they can verify your domain ownership before issuing the SSL/TLS certificate. For details, refer to [Domain control validation (DCV)](/ssl/edge-certificates/changing-dcv-method/).

### Solution

As these records are tied to the certificates, they cannot be deleted from the DNS tab of your Cloudflare dashboard.

If you need more `_acme-challenge.<hostname>` TXT records in order to provision certificates on your side, you can [manually add them](/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/create-dns-records/) under [DNS records](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/dns/records).

If you want to remove these records:

 * [Disable Universal SSL](/ssl/edge-certificates/universal-ssl/disable-universal-ssl/) to remove the records related to universal and backup certificates.
 * [Delete advanced certificates](/ssl/edge-certificates/advanced-certificate-manager/manage-certificates/#delete-a-certificate) to remove the records related to advanced certificates.

## Incorrect results for DNS queries

You notice DNS queries returning incorrect results even after you waited for the [TTL](/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/ttl/) to expire.

### Cause

Third-party tools can sometimes fail to return correct DNS results if a recursive DNS cache fails to refresh.

### Solution

In this circumstance, purge your public DNS cache via these methods:

- [Purge your DNS cache at OpenDNS](http://www.opendns.com/support/cache/)
- [Purge your DNS cache at Google](https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/cache)
- [Purge your DNS cache locally](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/dns/how-to-clear-your-dns-cache/)

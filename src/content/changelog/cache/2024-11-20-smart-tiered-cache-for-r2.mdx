You can now reduce latency and lower R2 egress costs automatically when using [Smart Tiered Cache](/cache/how-to/tiered-cache/) with [R2](/r2/). Cloudflare intelligently selects a tiered data center close to your R2 bucket location, creating an efficient caching topology without additional configuration.

## How it works

When you enable [Smart Tiered Cache](/cache/how-to/tiered-cache/) for zones using [R2](/r2/) as an origin, Cloudflare automatically:

1. **Identifies your R2 bucket location**: Determines the geographical region where your R2 bucket is stored.
2. **Selects an optimal Upper Tier**: Chooses a data center close to your bucket as the common Upper Tier cache.
3. **Routes requests efficiently**: All cache misses in edge locations route through this Upper Tier before reaching R2.

## Benefits

- **Automatic optimization**: No manual configuration required.
- **Lower egress costs**: Fewer requests to R2 reduce egress charges.
- **Improved hit ratio**: Common Upper Tier increases cache efficiency.
- **Reduced latency**: Upper Tier proximity to R2 minimizes fetch times.

## Get started

To get started, enable [Smart Tiered Cache](/cache/how-to/tiered-cache/) on your zone using R2 as an origin.

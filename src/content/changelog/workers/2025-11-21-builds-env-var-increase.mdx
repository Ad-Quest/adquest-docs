[Workers Builds](/workers/ci-cd/builds/) now supports up to 64 environment variables, and each environment variable can be up to 5 KB in size. The previous limit was 5 KB total across all environment variables.



This change enables better support for complex build configurations, larger application settings, and more flexible CI/CD workflows.


For more details, refer to the [build limits documentation](/workers/ci-cd/builds/limits-and-pricing/#environment-variable-limits).

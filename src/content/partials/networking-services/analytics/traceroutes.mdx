You can run traceroutes to analyze the hop-by-hop Internet path and latency between Cloudflare's network and your network.

To run a traceroute from a specific Cloudflare data center to your network:

You can access detailed data from the traceroute, including:

- Time to live (TTL) and host
- Autonomous system (AS) number
- [Packets](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-a-packet/) sent in the traceroute
- Average, minimum, and maximum latency
- Standard deviation of latency

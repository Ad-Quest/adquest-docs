:::note

To reduce latency, use a [Placement Hint](/workers/configuration/smart-placement/#use-placement-hints) to run your Worker close to your PlanetScale database. This is especially useful when a single request makes multiple queries.

```jsonc title="wrangler.jsonc"
{
	"placement": {
		// Match to your PlanetScale region, for example "gcp:us-east4" or "aws:us-east-1"
		"region": "gcp:us-east4",
	},
}
```

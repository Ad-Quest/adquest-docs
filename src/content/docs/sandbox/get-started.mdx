Build your first application with Sandbox SDK - a secure code execution environment. In this guide, you'll create a Worker that can execute Python code and work with files in isolated containers.

:::note[What you're building]
A simple API that can safely execute Python code and perform file operations in isolated sandbox environments.
:::

## Prerequisites

<Render file="prereqs" product="workers" />

### Ensure Docker is running locally

Sandbox SDK uses [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to build container images alongside your Worker. Docker must be running when you deploy or run locally.

Install Docker by following the [Docker Desktop installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/).

Verify Docker is running:

```sh
docker info
```

If Docker is not running, this command will hang or return "Cannot connect to the Docker daemon".

## 1. Create a new project

Create a new Sandbox SDK project:

<PackageManagers
	type="create"
	pkg="cloudflare@latest"
	args={"my-sandbox --template=cloudflare/sandbox-sdk/examples/minimal"}
/>

This creates a `my-sandbox` directory with everything you need:

- `src/index.ts` - Worker with sandbox integration
- `wrangler.jsonc` - Configuration for Workers and Containers
- `Dockerfile` - Container environment definition

```sh
cd my-sandbox
```

## 2. Explore the template

The template provides a minimal Worker that demonstrates core sandbox capabilities:

```typescript
import { getSandbox, proxyToSandbox, type Sandbox } from '@cloudflare/sandbox';

export { Sandbox } from '@cloudflare/sandbox';

type Env = {
  Sandbox: DurableObjectNamespace<Sandbox>;
};

export default {
  async fetch(request: Request, env: Env): Promise<Response> {
    // Required for preview URLs (if you expose ports later)
    const proxyResponse = await proxyToSandbox(request, env);
    if (proxyResponse) return proxyResponse;

    const url = new URL(request.url);

    // Get or create a sandbox instance
    const sandbox = getSandbox(env.Sandbox, 'my-sandbox');

    // Execute Python code
    if (url.pathname === '/run') {
      const result = await sandbox.exec('python -c "print(2 + 2)"');
      return Response.json({
        output: result.stdout,
        success: result.success
      });
    }

    // Work with files
    if (url.pathname === '/file') {
      await sandbox.writeFile('/workspace/hello.txt', 'Hello, Sandbox!');
      const file = await sandbox.readFile('/workspace/hello.txt');
      return Response.json({
        content: file.content
      });
    }

    return new Response('Try /run or /file');
  },
};
```

**Key concepts**:

- `getSandbox()` - Gets or creates a sandbox instance by ID
- `proxyToSandbox()` - Required at the top for preview URLs to work
- `sandbox.exec()` - Execute commands and capture output
- `sandbox.writeFile()` / `readFile()` - File operations

## 3. Test locally

Start the development server:

```sh
npm run dev
```

:::note
First run builds the Docker container (2-3 minutes). Subsequent runs are much faster due to caching.
:::

Test the endpoints:

```sh
# Execute Python code
curl http://localhost:8787/run

# File operations
curl http://localhost:8787/file
```

You should see JSON responses with the command output and file contents.

## 4. Deploy to production

Deploy your Worker and container:

```sh
npx wrangler deploy
```

This will:
1. Build your container image using Docker
2. Push it to Cloudflare's Container Registry
3. Deploy your Worker globally

:::caution[Wait for provisioning]
After first deployment, wait 2-3 minutes before making requests. The Worker deploys immediately, but the container needs time to provision.
:::

Check deployment status:

```sh
npx wrangler containers list
```

## 5. Test your deployment

Visit your Worker URL (shown in deploy output):

```sh
# Replace with your actual URL
curl https://my-sandbox.YOUR_SUBDOMAIN.workers.dev/run
```

Your sandbox is now deployed.

## Understanding the configuration

Your `wrangler.jsonc` connects three pieces together:

<WranglerConfig>

```jsonc
{
  "containers": [
    {
      "class_name": "Sandbox",
      "image": "./Dockerfile"
    }
  ],
  "durable_objects": {
    "bindings": [
      {
        "class_name": "Sandbox",
        "name": "Sandbox"
      }
    ]
  },
  "migrations": [
    {
      "new_sqlite_classes": ["Sandbox"],
      "tag": "v1"
    }
  ]
}
```

</WranglerConfig>

- **containers** - Your Dockerfile defines the execution environment
- **durable_objects** - Makes the `Sandbox` binding available in your Worker
- **migrations** - Initializes Durable Object storage (required once)

For detailed configuration options including environment variables, secrets, and custom images, see the [Wrangler configuration reference](/sandbox/configuration/wrangler/).

## Next steps

Now that you have a working sandbox, explore more capabilities:

- [Execute commands](/sandbox/guides/execute-commands/) - Run shell commands and stream output
- [Manage files](/sandbox/guides/manage-files/) - Work with files and directories
- [Expose services](/sandbox/guides/expose-services/) - Get public URLs for services running in your sandbox
- [API reference](/sandbox/api/) - Complete API documentation

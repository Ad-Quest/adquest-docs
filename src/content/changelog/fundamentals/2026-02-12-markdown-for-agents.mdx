Cloudflare's network now supports real-time content conversion at the source, for enabled zones using [content negotiation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/Content_negotiation) headers. When AI systems request pages from any website that uses Cloudflare and has Markdown for Agents enabled, they can express the preference for `text/markdown` in the request: our network will automatically and efficiently convert the HTML to markdown, when possible, on the fly.


Here is a curl example with the `Accept` negotiation header requesting this page from our developer documentation:

```bash
curl https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/reference/markdown-for-agents/ \
  -H "Accept: text/markdown"
```

The response to this request is now formatted in markdown:

```http
HTTP/2 200
date: Wed, 11 Feb 2026 11:44:48 GMT
content-type: text/markdown; charset=utf-8
content-length: 2899
vary: accept
x-markdown-tokens: 725
content-signal: ai-train=yes, search=yes, ai-input=yes

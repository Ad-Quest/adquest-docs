This guide instructs you on how to:

- View AI crawlers that are interacting with pages in your domain (a [Cloudflare zone](/fundamentals/concepts/accounts-and-zones/#zones)).
- Use AI Crawl Control to block individual crawlers from accessing your content.

## Prerequisites

1. Sign up for a [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up/).
2. [Connect your domain to Cloudflare](/fundamentals/manage-domains/add-site/).
3. Make sure your domain is [proxying traffic through Cloudflare](/fundamentals/concepts/how-cloudflare-works/#cloudflare-as-a-reverse-proxy).

## 1. Monitor AI crawler activity at a glance

<Steps>
1. Go to **AI Crawl Control**.

   <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/:zone/ai" />

2. Review the snapshot of your AI crawler activity in the **Overview** tab.
3. Use the filters to view activity by specific date ranges, crawlers, operators, hostnames, or paths.
</Steps>

## 2. Block specific AI crawlers

<Steps>
1. Go to **AI Crawl Control**.

   <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/:zone/ai" />

2. Review which AI crawlers are accessing your domain in the **Crawlers** tab.
3. In the **Action** column, select **Block**.
</Steps>

:::note[Quality of AI crawler detection]
On the free plan, AI Crawl Control identifies AI crawlers based on their [user agent strings](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/User-Agent). This enables AI Crawl Control to detect well-known, self-identifying AI crawlers.

Upgrade your plan to enable a more thorough detection using Cloudflare's [Bot Management detection ID](/bots/reference/bot-management-variables/#ruleset-engine-fields) field.

When trying to upgrade a domain or purchase a subscription, you may see an error that contains one of the following phrases:

* "this zone cannot be upgraded"
* "there is a problem with your billing profile"

## Causes
* Your account may have an outstanding unpaid balance
* Another account previously associated with the domain / zone your purchase relates to has an outstanding unpaid balance

## Solution
This message appears when the account or domain involved has an outstanding unpaid balance. In the case of a domain, this may also be triggered by a previous account that owned the domain. To resolve this you will need to:

1. Check each Cloudflare account you have access to for an outstanding balance. Refer to [Email address and password](/fundamentals/user-profiles/change-password-or-email/) if you have forgotten these details.
2. Refer to [Pay an overdue balance](/billing/pay-invoices-overdue-balances/#pay-an-overdue-balance) to pay this balance
3. Wait 24 hours after paying this balance
4. Attempt to upgrade again

As a reference, the full error messages you may see are:

* "Due to a Billing related issue, the zone cannot be upgraded at this time. Please visit the Billing section to ensure there is no outstanding balance."
* "Refer to https://cfl.re/3VUQyyL for assistance. For security reasons, there is a problem with your billing profile."

## Disable Pay Per Crawl by URI pattern

You may want to offer free access to certain pages while charging for others:

- Allow free access to **homepages, category pages, or navigation** to help crawlers discover paid content.
- Exclude functional pages like **login, search, or API endpoints** that don't contain chargeable content.
- Start with Pay Per Crawl on **a small section of your site** before expanding.
- Offer free access to **promotional or archived content** while charging for premium articles.

To get started, use [Configuration Rules](/rules/configuration-rules/) to exclude specific URI patterns from charging.

1. Go to **Rules** > **Overview** in the Cloudflare dashboard.

   <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/:zone/rules/overview" />

2. Select **Create rule** > **Configuration Rule**.

3. **When incoming requests match**: Set your URI pattern.
   - Field: `URI Full`
   - Operator: `wildcard`
   - Value: `https://*example.com/public/*`

4. Select **Disable Pay Per Crawl** > **Add**

5. Select **Deploy**.

**Example patterns:**

- Free homepage: `URI Full` equals `https://example.com/`
- Free directory: `URI Full` wildcard `https://*example.com/public/*`

:::note
Some paths are always free to crawl. These paths are: `/robots.txt`, `/sitemap.xml`, `/security.txt`, `/.well-known/security.txt`, `/crawlers.json`

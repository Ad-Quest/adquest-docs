## Errors & Troubleshooting

### Error: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'fetch')

This error typically occurs because your Puppeteer launch is not receiving the browser binding. To resolve this error, pass your browser binding into `puppeteer.launch`.

### Error: 429 browser time limit exceeded

This error (`Unable to create new browser: code: 429: message: Browser time limit exceeded for today`) indicates you have hit the daily browser-instance limit on the Workers Free plan. [Workers Free plan accounts are capped at 10 minutes of browser use a day](/browser-rendering/limits/#workers-free). Once you exceed that limit, further creation attempts return a 429 error until the next UTC day.

To resolve this error, [upgrade to a Workers Paid plan](/workers/platform/pricing/) which allows for more than 10 minutes of usage a day and has higher [limits](/browser-rendering/limits/#workers-paid). If you recently upgraded but still see this error, try redeploying your Worker to ensure your usage is correctly associated with your new plan.

### Error: 422 unprocessable entity

A `422 Unprocessable Entity` error usually means that Browser Rendering wasn't able to complete an action because of an issue with the site.

This can happen if:
- The website consumes too much memory during rendering.
- The page itself crashed or returned an error before the action completed.
- The request exceeded one of the [timeout limits](/browser-rendering/reference/timeouts/) for page load, element load, or an action.

Most often, this error is caused by a timeout. You can review the different timers and their limits in the [REST API timeouts reference](/browser-rendering/reference/timeouts/).

### Why is my page content missing or incomplete?

If your screenshots, PDFs, or scraped content are missing elements that appear when viewing the page in a browser, the page likely has not finished loading before Browser Rendering captures the output.

JavaScript-heavy pages and Single Page Applications (SPAs) often load content dynamically after the initial HTML is parsed. By default, Browser Rendering waits for `domcontentloaded`, which fires before JavaScript has finished rendering the page.

To fix this, use the `goToOptions.waitUntil` parameter with one of these values:

| Value              | Use when                                                                 |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `networkidle0`     | The page must be completely idle (no network requests for 500 ms). Best for pages that load all content upfront. |
| `networkidle2`     | The page can have up to 2 ongoing connections (like analytics or websockets). Best for most dynamic pages. |

REST API example:
```json
{
  "url": "https://example.com",
  "goToOptions": {
    "waitUntil": "networkidle2"
  }
}
```

If content is still missing:
- Use `waitForSelector` to wait for a specific element to appear before capturing.
- Increase `goToOptions.timeout` (up to 60 seconds) for slow-loading pages.
- Check if the page requires authentication or returns different content to bots.

For a complete reference, see [REST API timeouts](/browser-rendering/reference/timeouts/).

## Getting started & Development

### Does local development support all Browser Rendering features?

Not yet. Local development currently has the following limitation(s):
- Requests larger than 1 MB are not supported.

<Render file="remote-binding-note" product="workers" />

### Will Browser Rendering be detected by Bot Management?

Yes, Browser Rendering requests are always identified as bot traffic by Cloudflare. Cloudflare does not enforce bot protection by default — that is the customer's choice.

If you are attempting to scan your own zone and want Browser Rendering to access your website freely without your bot protection configuration interfering, you can create a WAF skip rule to [allowlist Browser Rendering](/browser-rendering/faq/#how-do-i-allowlist-browser-rendering).

### Can I allowlist Browser Rendering on my own website?

You must be on an Enterprise plan to allowlist Browser Rendering on your own website because WAF custom rules require access to [Bot Management](/bots/get-started/bot-management/) fields.

<Steps>
1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Security rules** page of your account and domain.

     <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/:zone/security/security-rules" />

2. To create a new empty rule, select **Create rule** > **Custom rules**.
3. Enter a descriptive name for the rule in **Rule name**, such as `Allow Browser Rendering`.
4. Under **When incoming requests match**, use the **Field** dropdown to choose _Bot Detection ID_. For **Operator**, select _equals_. For **Value**, enter `128292352`.
5. Under **Then take action**, in the **Choose action** dropdown, select  **Skip**.
6. Under **Place at**, select the order of the rule in the **Select order** dropdown to be **First**. Setting the order as **First** allows this rule to be applied before subsequent rules.
7. To save and deploy your rule, select **Deploy**.

</Steps>

### Does Browser Rendering rotate IP addresses for outbound requests?

No. Browser Rendering requests originate from Cloudflare's global network and you cannot configure per-request IP rotation. All rendering traffic comes from Cloudflare IP ranges and requests include [automatic headers](/browser-rendering/reference/automatic-request-headers/), such as `cf-biso-request-id` and `cf-biso-devtools` so origin servers can identify them.

### Is there a limit to how many requests a single browser session can handle?

There is no fixed limit on the number of requests per browser session. A single browser can handle multiple requests as long as it stays within available compute and memory limits.

### Can I use custom fonts in Browser Rendering?

Yes. If your webpage or PDF requires a font that is not pre-installed, you can load custom fonts at render time using `addStyleTag`. This works with both the [REST API](/browser-rendering/rest-api/) and [Workers Bindings](/browser-rendering/workers-bindings/). For instructions and examples, refer to [Use your own custom font](/browser-rendering/reference/supported-fonts/#use-your-own-custom-font).

## Security & Data Handling

### Does Cloudflare store or retain the HTML content I submit for rendering?

No. Cloudflare processes content ephemerally and does not retain customer-submitted HTML or generated output (such as PDFs or screenshots) beyond what is required to perform the rendering operation. Once the response is returned, the content is immediately discarded from the rendering environment.

This applies to both the [REST API](/browser-rendering/rest-api/) and [Workers Bindings](/browser-rendering/workers-bindings/) (using `@cloudflare/puppeteer` or `@cloudflare/playwright`).

### Is there any temporary caching of submitted content?

For the [REST API](/browser-rendering/rest-api/), generated content is cached by default for five seconds (configurable up to one day via the `cacheTTL` parameter, or set to `0` to disable caching). This cache protects against repeated requests for the same URL by the same account. Customer-submitted HTML content itself is not cached.

For [Workers Bindings](/browser-rendering/workers-bindings/), no caching is used. Content exists only in memory for the duration of the rendering operation and is discarded immediately after the response is returned.

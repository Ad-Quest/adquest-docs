A Virtual Network Computer (VNC) server provides users with remote access to a computer's desktop environment. Cloudflare can render a VNC terminal in the browser without any client-side software or configuration.

Browser-rendered VNC requires connecting the VNC server to Cloudflare and routing traffic through a public hostname. To access the VNC server, users go to the public hostname URL and log in using their Cloudflare Access credentials. Cloudflare will apply your Access policies and, when a user is allowed, render a VNC client in their browser.

:::note
There are a number of different VNC server versions, deployments, and instances. This guide uses TightVNC running an XFCE desktop, but browser-rendered VNC will work with most configurations.
:::

## Prerequisites

- An [active domain on Cloudflare](/fundamentals/manage-domains/add-site/).
- The domain uses either a [full setup](/dns/zone-setups/full-setup/) or a [partial (`CNAME`) setup](/dns/zone-setups/partial-setup/).

## 1. Set up a VNC server

For demonstration purposes, we will create a TightVNC server on an Ubuntu virtual machine (VM) hosted in Google Cloud Project (GCP). We will configure the VNC server to run XFCE, a lightweight desktop environment suitable for remote access. If you already have a VNC server installed, you can skip this step and [go to Step 2](#2-connect-the-server-to-cloudflare).

1. Open a terminal window for your Ubuntu VM.

2. Install XFCE and TightVNC by running the following command:

		```sh
		sudo apt update
		sudo apt install xfce4 xfce4-goodies dbus-x11 tightvncserver -y

		```

		This command installs the desktop, some helpful utilities, and the VNC server software.

3. To initialize the VNC server:

	a. Create a VNC server instance:

		```sh
		vncserver
		```

	b. You will be prompted to set a password. This password will be used to connect to your VNC server. It is limited to 8 characters.

		TightVNC will now create configuration files and start a VNC session on display `:1` (which uses port `5901`).

	c. You will be asked if you want to create a view-only password. You can press `n` for no.

	d. Kill this initial session so that you can edit its configuration:

		```sh
		vncserver -kill :1
		```
4. Configure VNC to launch the XFCE desktop:

	a. Create a VNC configuration directory if it is missing:

	```sh
	mkdir -p ~/.vnc
	```

	b. Open the `xstartup` file using a text editor. For example,

	```sh
	vim ~/.vnc/xstartup
	```

	c. Update the file to the following configuration:

	```bash
	#!/bin/sh
	unset SESSION_MANAGER
	unset DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS
	startxfce4
	```

	d. Make the file executable:

	```sh
	chmod +x ~/.vnc/xstartup
	```

5. Start the VNC server again:
	```sh
	vncserver -localhost :1
	```

	The `-localhost` flag ensures the VNC server only listens for connections from the VM itself, not from the public internet. Your VNC server is now running on port `5901`, but it is only accessible from `localhost` (`127.0.0.1`) inside the VM.

6. (Recommended) Test the VNC server with an existing VNC client to verify any missing packages or configuration changes. For example, to test a VNC server hosted on GCP:

	a. Open a terminal on the client machine.

	b. Connect to the VNC server over SSH, forwarding your local port `5901` to the VNC server's listening port:

		```sh
		gcloud compute ssh [YOUR_VM_NAME] --zone=[YOUR_ZONE] -- -L 5901:localhost:5901
		```

	c. Open your preferred VNC viewer application.

	d. In the VNC viewer, connect to the address `localhost:5901` and enter your VNC server password.

	You should see the Ubuntu VM desktop.

7. (Optional) Configure the VNC server to start on boot:

	a. Find the full path to the `vncserver` command:

		```sh
		which vncserver
		```
		```sh output
		/usr/bin/vncserver
		```
	b. Create a new service configuration file:

	```sh
	sudo vim /etc/systemd/system/vncserver@.service
	```

	c. Copy and paste the following content. Replace `[YOUR_USERNAME]` with the VNC server user. If needed, update `/usr/bin/vncserver` to your `vncserver` path.

		```toml
		[Unit]
		Description=Start TightVNC server at startup
		After=syslog.target network.target

		[Service]
		Type=forking
		User=[YOUR_USERNAME]
		WorkingDirectory=/home/[YOUR_USERNAME]

		PIDFile=/home/[YOUR_USERNAME]/.vnc/%H:%i.pid

		ExecStartPre=-/usr/bin/vncserver -kill :%i > /dev/null 2>&1
		ExecStart=/usr/bin/vncserver -localhost :%i
		ExecStop=/usr/bin/vncserver -kill :%i

		[Install]
		WantedBy=multi-user.target
		```

		c. Reload `systemd` to read in the new service file:

		```sh
		sudo systemctl daemon-reload
		```

		e. Enable the service to start at boot:

		```sh
		sudo systemctl enable vncserver@1.service
		```

		The `1` variable configures the VNC service to use display `:1` (which runs on port `5901`).

		f. By default, `systemd` user services only run when that user is logged in. To allow your VNC service to start on boot (before you log in), enable user linger for your user:

		```sh
		sudo loginctl enable-linger [YOUR_USERNAME]
		```

		g. Start the service:

		```sh
		sudo systemctl start vncserver@1.service
		```

		h. Check its status:

		```sh
		sudo systemctl status vncserver@1.service
		```

		The VNC server will now start automatically every time the VM boots.

## 2. Connect the server to Cloudflare

1. Create a Cloudflare Tunnel by following our [dashboard setup guide](/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/get-started/create-remote-tunnel/).

2. Go to **Networks** > **Connectors**. Select your tunnel and select **Edit**.

3. Select the **Published application routes** tab, then select **Add a published application route**.

4. Choose a domain from the drop-down menu and specify any subdomain (for example, `vnc.example.com`).

5. For **Service**, select _TCP_ and enter `localhost:<5901>`. If the VNC server is on a different machine from where you installed the tunnel, enter `<SERVER_IP>:5901`.

	Replace `5901` with your VNC server's listening port. To determine your VNC listening port, run `sudo ss -lnpt` and look for `vnc` in the list of processes.

6. Save the route.

Your VNC server is now ready to accept inbound requests from Cloudflare.

## 3. Create an Access application for VNC

Create a Cloudflare Access application that users can access through their browser:

1. In [Cloudflare One](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com), go to **Access controls** > **Applications**.

2. Select **Add an application**.

3. Select **Self-hosted**.

4. Enter any name for the application.

5. Select **Add public hostname** and enter your published application hostname (`vnc.example.com`).

6. In **Browser rendering settings**, set **Browser rendering** to _VNC_.

7. <Render file="access/add-access-policies" product="cloudflare-one" />

	<Render file="access/self-hosted-app/browser-rendering-policies" product="cloudflare-one" />

8. Save the application.

## 4. Connect as a user

To connect to the VNC server:

1. Open a browser and go to the public hostname URL (for example, `https://vnc.example.com`).
2. Log in to Cloudflare Access with your configured identity provider.
3. Enter the VNC server password.

You now have access to the remote desktop.

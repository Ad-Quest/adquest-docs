    In this video learn how Cloudflare's SASE platform can provide highly secure access to your critical infrastructure by leveraging a modern ZTNA service to implement Zero Trust principles. Applications, databases and their servers are running in a variety of locations from on-premises data centers to cloud hyperscalers, making the need to secure administrative access more important than ever.

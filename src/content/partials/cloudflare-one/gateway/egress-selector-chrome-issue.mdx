Starting with [Chrome 142](https://developer.chrome.com/release-notes/142), the browser restricts requests from websites to local IP addresses, including the Gateway <GlossaryTooltip term="initial resolved IP">initial resolved IP </GlossaryTooltip> CGNAT range (`100.80.0.0/16`). When a website attempts to access a domain resolved through an initial resolved IP, the browser will display a prompt from the website asking to look for and connect to devices on the local network. Chrome will block requests to these domains until the user accepts this prompt.

To avoid this issue, choose one of the following options:

- Disable the Chrome feature flag: Go to `chrome://flags` and set the **Local Network Access Checks** flag to _Disabled_.
- Configure Chrome Enterprise policy: Use the **LocalNetworkAccessAllowedForUrls** policy to allow specific websites to make requests to these domains. For more information, refer to the [Chrome Enterprise documentation](https://chromeenterprise.google/policies/#LocalNetworkAccessAllowedForUrls).

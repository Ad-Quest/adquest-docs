Customers with access to the Magic Transit on-demand option can [configure prefix advertisement](/byoip/concepts/dynamic-advertisement/best-practices/#configure-dynamic-advertisement) from the **IP Prefixes** page in their Cloudflare account home or through the [Cloudflare API](/api/resources/addressing/subresources/prefixes/subresources/advertisement_status/methods/edit/).

A common workflow is to enable prefix advertisement during an attack so that you can take advantage of Cloudflare protection and then disable advertisement once the incident is resolved. Prefixes using BGP-controlled advertisements are not compatible with dynamic advertisement (through the dashboard or API). Specify your preferred on-demand advertisement method during prefix onboarding.

To ensure smooth operation and simplify the advertisement process during an attack scenario, refer to [Dynamic advertisement: Best practices](/byoip/concepts/dynamic-advertisement/best-practices/).

:::note
Magic Transit on-demand cannot be used with Cloudflare leased IPs.

To provide more granular controls, we refined the [existing roles](/cloudflare-one/roles-permissions/#email-security-roles) for Email Security and launched a new Email Security role as well. 


All Email Security roles no longer have read or write access to any of the other Zero Trust products:
-   **Email Configuration Admin**
-   **Email Integration Admin**
-   **Email Security Read Only**
-   **Email Security Analyst**
-   **Email Security Policy Admin**
-   **Email Security Reporting**


To configure [Data Loss Prevention (DLP)](/cloudflare-one/email-security/outbound-dlp/) or [Remote Browser Isolation (RBI)](/cloudflare-one/remote-browser-isolation/setup/clientless-browser-isolation/#set-up-clientless-web-isolation), you now need to be an admin for the Zero Trust dashboard with the **Cloudflare Zero Trust** role.


Also through customer feedback, we have created a new additive role to allow **Email Security Analyst** to create, edit, and delete Email Security policies, without needing to provide access via the **Email Configuration Admin** role. This role is called **Email Security Policy Admin**, which can read all settings, but has write access to [allow policies](/cloudflare-one/email-security/detection-settings/allow-policies/), [trusted domains](/cloudflare-one/email-security/detection-settings/trusted-domains/), and [blocked senders](/cloudflare-one/email-security/detection-settings/blocked-senders/).




This feature is available across these Email Security packages: 
-   **Advantage** 
-   **Enterprise** 
-   **Enterprise + PhishGuard**

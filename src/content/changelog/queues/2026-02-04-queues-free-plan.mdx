[Cloudflare Queues](/queues) is now part of the Workers free plan, offering guaranteed message delivery across up to **10,000 queues** to either [Cloudflare Workers](/workers) or [HTTP pull consumers](/queues/configuration/pull-consumers). Every Cloudflare account now includes **10,000 operations per day** across reads, writes, and deletes. For more details on how each operation is defined, refer to [Queues pricing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/pricing/#queues).

All features of the existing Queues functionality are available on the free plan, including unlimited [event subscriptions](/queues/event-subscriptions/). Note that the maximum retention period on the free tier, however, is 24 hours rather than 14 days. 

If you are new to Cloudflare Queues, follow [this guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/queues/get-started/) or try one of our [tutorials](/queues/tutorials/) to get started.

New reference documentation is now available for AI Crawl Control:

- **[GraphQL API reference](/ai-crawl-control/reference/graphql-api/)** — Query examples for crawler requests, top paths, referral traffic, and data transfer. Includes key filters for detection IDs, user agents, and referrer domains.
- **[Bot reference](/ai-crawl-control/reference/bots/)** — Detection IDs and user agents for major AI crawlers from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, and others.
- **[Worker templates](/ai-crawl-control/reference/worker-templates/)** — Deploy the x402 Payment-Gated Proxy to monetize crawler access or charge bots while letting humans through free.

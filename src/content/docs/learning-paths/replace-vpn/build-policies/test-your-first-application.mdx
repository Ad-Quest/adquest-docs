You have now set up your [Zero Trust organization](/learning-paths/replace-vpn/get-started/), [configured the WARP client](/learning-paths/replace-vpn/configure-device-agent/), [installed it on devices](/learning-paths/replace-vpn/connect-devices/), and created your [Access and Gateway policies](/learning-paths/replace-vpn/build-policies/). The next step is to test those policies.

## 1. Manually test your policies

Test if the Access or Gateway policy that you configured is working by using a device with the WARP client installed to reach an internal application or external website.

If you cannot reach an application protected by Access or an external application through Gateway as expected, Cloudflare recommends starting with reviewing your WARP configuration.

### 1.1. Troubleshoot WARP

If your manual test fails, troubleshoot the WARP client. Cloudflare recommends starting with reviewing your WARP configuration because misconfiguration is the most common cause of connectivity issues.

- [WARP troubleshooting guide](/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/warp/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-guide/): Step-by-step instructions to debug WARP client issues.
- [WARP client errors](/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/warp/troubleshooting/client-errors/): If you are receiving an error, review the associated solutions.
- [WARP connectivity status](/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/warp/troubleshooting/connectivity-status/): Review the connectivity stage of the WARP daemon as it establishes a connection from the device to Cloudflare.
- [WARP with Firewall](/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/warp/deployment/firewall/): Ensure you have exempted the correct IP addresses and domains to allow the WARP client to connect.

### 1.2. Review analytics

Analytics provide visualizations of [log data](/learning-paths/replace-vpn/build-policies/test-your-first-application/#review-logs). To review Access or Gateway analytics:

1. In [Cloudflare One](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/), go to **Insights** > **Analytics** > **Dashboards**.
2. Select **[Access event analytics](/cloudflare-one/insights/analytics/access/)** for a summary of login events or **[Application Access Report](/cloudflare-one/insights/analytics/application-access/)** for a summary of overall Access Activity. 
3. Select the **HTTP request analytics**, **DNS query analytics** or **Network session analytics** depending on [your Gateway investigation scope](/cloudflare-one/insights/analytics/gateway/).

### 1.3. Review logs

[Logs](/cloudflare-one/insights/logs/) provide event-level (such as an authentication attempt or a DNS query) visibility into your Cloudflare One environment. 

To review traffic activity for applications protected by Access: 
1. In [Cloudflare One](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/), go to **Insights** > **Analytics** > **Logs**.
2. Select **Access authentication logs**.
3. Review the [per-request logs](/cloudflare-one/insights/logs/audit-logs/#per-request-logs) for your application.

To review traffic activity in the [Gateway logs](/cloudflare-one/insights/logs/gateway-logs/): 
1. In [Cloudflare One](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/), go to **Insights** > **Analytics** > **Logs**.
2. Select **HTTP request logs**, **Network logs**, or **DNS query logs** depending on your investigation scope.

Refer to [Troubleshoot Gateway](/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/troubleshoot-gateway/) to troubleshoot common issues with Gateway egress policies.

## 2. Monitor your policies and device connectivity

After you confirm your policies work by testing manually, use DEX to monitor connectivity and performance over time.

<Render file="dex/intro" product="cloudflare-one" />

Refer to [Digital Experience Monitoring (DEX)](/cloudflare-one/insights/dex/) for more information.

### Example use case 

- Imagine that you have three devices, with the WARP client installed, set up in your testing environment.
- You have set up a [Cloudflare Tunnel](/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/) and an [Access policy](/cloudflare-one/access-controls/policies/) for your internal wiki that is available at `wiki.acme.org`.
- You [manually tested](/learning-paths/replace-vpn/build-policies/test-your-first-application/#manually-test-your-policies) the three WARP client devices, and you confirmed they can all reach `wiki.acme.org`.
- You want to set up automated connectivity and performance testing to `wiki.acme.org` for each of these WARP client devices so you can monitor them over time.
- You set up a DEX test, and it sends an HTTP GET request to `wiki.acme.org` from all three WARP devices on a five minute interval.
- If WARP device connectivity drops, or if there are performance problems, you can see the DEX test results to troubleshoot the problem.

### 2.1. Create a DEX test

<Render file="dex/tests-intro" product="cloudflare-one" />

Refer to [DEX tests](/cloudflare-one/insights/dex/tests/) for more information.

<Render file="dex/http-test-intro" product="cloudflare-one" />

<Render file="dex/http-test-create-steps" product="cloudflare-one" />

#### HTTP test results

<Render file="dex/http-test-results-metrics" product="cloudflare-one" />

### 2.2. Set up notifications

<Render file="dex/notifications-intro" product="cloudflare-one" />

Refer to [DEX Notifications](/cloudflare-one/insights/dex/notifications/) for more information on DEX-specific notifications.

#### Device anomaly notification setup

Customers who want to be notified when Cloudflare detects a spike or drop in the number of devices connected to the WARP client can create a [Device connectivity anomaly](/cloudflare-one/insights/dex/notifications/#available-notifications) notification.

To create a device connectivity anomaly notification:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Notifications** page.
  
    <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/notifications" />
2. Select **Add**.
3. Find **Product** DEX and **Alert type** Device connectivity anomaly, and choose **Select**.
4. Name the notification.
5. Enter an email address to receive the notifications or set up a [webhook](/notifications/get-started/configure-webhooks/).
6. (Optional) Specify any additional options for the notification, if required. For example, some notifications require that you select one or more domains or services.
7. Select **Create**.

Refer to [Notifications](/notifications/get-started/) for more information on editing, testing, and disabling notifications.

## Conclusion

Once your policies are live, you can use [DEX tests](/learning-paths/replace-vpn/build-policies/test-your-first-application/#create-a-dex-test) and [notifications](/learning-paths/replace-vpn/build-policies/test-your-first-application/#notifications) to ensure your team has secure, reliable access to internal and external resources.

Cloudflare measures Magic WAN usage based on the 95th percentile of bandwidth utilized by your configured network.

## How bandwidth is measured

Magic WAN bandwidth includes the sum of traffic routed to and from the Magic WAN network namespace. This measurement includes traffic from the following tunnel types:

- [GRE (Generic Routing Encapsulation)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-gre-tunneling/)
- [IPsec (Internet Protocol Security)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-ipsec/)
- <a href={props.cloudflareTunnelURL}>Cloudflare Tunnel</a>
- [Cloudflare Network Interconnect](/network-interconnect/)

For each tunnel, Cloudflare uses the highest 95th percentile value (ingress or egress traffic). The usage measurement excludes [WARP](/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/warp/) traffic.

## 95th percentile calculation

To measure the 95th percentile bandwidth at each tunnel, Cloudflare records bandwidth to and from the global network at five-minute intervals, sorts these measurements in descending order, and discards the top 5% of recorded measurements. The highest remaining value is the 95th percentile bandwidth measurement for that time period.

<Steps>

1. Check that the local participant has permission to remove participants.

   ```ts
   const canKickParticipant = meeting.self.permissions.kickParticipant === true;
   if (!canKickParticipant) {
   	// Disable the control in your UI.
   }
   ```

2. Call `kick()` on the target participant.

   If the local participant does not have the required permission, `kick()` throws a `ClientError` with code `1201`.

   ```ts
   try {
   	await participant.kick();
   } catch (err: any) {
   	if (err?.code === 1201) {
   		// The local participant does not have permission to remove participants.
   		return;
   	}
   	throw err;
   }
   ```

3. Handle the result by listening for updates.

   After the call succeeds:
   - The kicked participant is removed from `meeting.participants.joined`.
   - The participant is removed from other participant maps they were in (for example, `meeting.participants.pinned`).
   - The SDK emits `participantLeft` on `meeting.participants.joined`.

   ```ts
   meeting.participants.joined.on("participantLeft", (participant) => {
   	// Remove the participant tile from the UI.
   });
   ```

   Other participants in the session also observe the participant leaving through `participantLeft`.

4. On the removed participant's side, the session disconnects and `meeting.self` emits `roomLeft` event with state set to `kicked`.

   ```ts
   meeting.self.on("roomLeft", ({ state }) => {
   	if (state === "kicked") {
   		// Show a message and navigate the user out of the meeting UI.
   	}
   });
   ```

</Steps>

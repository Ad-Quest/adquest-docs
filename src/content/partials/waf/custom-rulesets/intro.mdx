Custom rulesets are collections of custom rules that you can deploy at the { props.scope == "account" ? "account" : "zone" } or {props.scope == "account" ? <a href="/waf/custom-rules/custom-rulesets/">zone level</a> : <a href="/waf/account/custom-rulesets/">account level</a> }.

Like [custom rules](/waf/custom-rules/){props.scope == "account" && " at the zone level" }, custom rulesets allow you to control incoming traffic by filtering requests. For example, you can apply a custom ruleset to all incoming {props.scope == "account" ? "traffic of your Enterprise domains" : "requests of your zone" } or to a subset of incoming requests.

At the zone level, all customers can create and deploy custom rulesets. Custom rulesets at the account level require an Enterprise plan with a paid add-on. For more details, refer to [Availability](/waf/custom-rules/#availability).

:::caution[Anycast routing]
Cloudflare uses anycast to route traffic. Anycast is a network addressing and routing method that routes incoming requests to a variety of different locations. Traffic may arrive at a different geographic location than expected. Not all requests go to the closest data center due to the complex nature of Internet routing and peering relationships, and how Cloudflare optimizes for performance and reliability.

To test Cloudflare's Magic Network Monitoring in a repeatable manner, devise a simulated DDoS attack. At a high level, you need to:

1. Select and install a trusted, open source DDoS simulation tool.
2. Conduct a small DDoS test attack in a safe test environment.

## Permission requirements

You need to contact Cloudflare to obtain permission before conducting a DDoS test if:

- Your property is hosted in Cloudflare.
- Internet traffic goes through Cloudflare before reaching your property.

Enterprise customers with Magic Network Monitoring enabled must contact their Cloudflare Account Manager before starting DDoS testing, even if the property is not hosted in Cloudflare.

Refer to [Simulating test DDoS attacks](/ddos-protection/reference/simulate-ddos-attack/) for more information.

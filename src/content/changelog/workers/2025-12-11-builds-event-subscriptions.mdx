You can now receive notifications when your Workers' builds start, succeed, fail, or get cancelled using [Event Subscriptions](/queues/event-subscriptions/).

[Workers Builds](/workers/ci-cd/builds/) publishes events to a [Queue](/queues/) that your Worker can read messages from, and then send notifications wherever you need — Slack, Discord, email, or any webhook endpoint.

You can deploy [this Worker](https://github.com/cloudflare/templates/tree/main/workers-builds-notifications-template) to your own Cloudflare account to send build notifications to Slack:

[![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/cloudflare/templates/tree/main/workers-builds-notifications-template)

The template includes:

- Build status with Preview/Live URLs for successful deployments
- Inline error messages for failed builds
- Branch, commit hash, and author name

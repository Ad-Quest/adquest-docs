The UI Kit components library provides a comprehensive set of pre-built, customizable components that you can use to build your own custom meeting interface.

<RTKSDKSelector />

:::note
All UI Kit components are built on top of Web Components, regardless of which framework (React/Angular) you use. They render as Web Components in the browser DOM.

**Component naming conventions:**

- **Web Components and Angular**: Use kebab-case (e.g., `rtk-meeting`)
- **React**: Use PascalCase (e.g., `RtkMeeting`)

React and Angular components are wrappers around the same underlying Web Components, so functionality is identical across all frameworks.

{props.productName} communicates periodically with Cloudflare via HTTPS. This is also known as a heartbeat, and lets Cloudflare know that the {props.productName} in question is connected to the Internet and reachable.

The heartbeat calls are made to `api.cloudflare.com`. Each {props.productName} has a heartbeat frequency of 10 seconds, independently of the number of WAN interfaces you have running on your device.

There are three symbols for the heartbeat signal that allow you to quickly check the status of {props.productName}:

- **Blue `i`**: {props.productName} is contacting Cloudflare as expected.
- **Yellow triangle**: {props.productName} has not yet connected to Cloudflare.
- **Red triangle**: There is a potential problem with {props.productName}.

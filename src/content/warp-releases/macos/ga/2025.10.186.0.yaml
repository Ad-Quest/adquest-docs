releaseNotes: |-
  This release contains minor fixes, improvements, and new features, including the ability to manage WARP client connectivity for all devices in your fleet using an [external signal](/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/warp/configure-warp/warp-settings/external-disconnect/).

  **Changes and improvements**
  - The [Local Domain Fallback](/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/warp/configure-warp/route-traffic/local-domains/) feature has been fixed for devices running WARP client version 2025.4.929.0 and newer. Previously, these devices could experience failures with Local Domain Fallback unless a fallback server was explicitly configured. This configuration is no longer a requirement for the feature to function correctly.
  - [Proxy mode](/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/warp/configure-warp/warp-modes/#proxy-mode) now supports transparent HTTP proxying in addition to CONNECT-based proxying.
  - Added a new feature to manage WARP client connectivity for all devices using an [external signal](/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/warp/configure-warp/warp-settings/external-disconnect/). This feature allows administrators to send a global signal from an on-premises HTTPS endpoint that force disconnects or reconnects all WARP clients in an account based on configuration set on the endpoint.

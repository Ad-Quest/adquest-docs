The Durable Object Storage API comes with several methods, including [SQL API](/durable-objects/api/sqlite-storage-api/#sql-api), [point-in-time-recovery (PITR) API](/durable-objects/api/sqlite-storage-api/#pitr-point-in-time-recovery-api), and [key-value (KV) API](/durable-objects/api/sqlite-storage-api/#synchronous-kv-api).

- Durable Object classes with the recommended [SQLite storage backend](/durable-objects/best-practices/access-durable-objects-storage/#sqlite-storage-backend) can use SQL API, PITR API, and KV API. KV API methods like `get()`, `put()`, `delete()`, or `list()` store data in a hidden SQLite table.
- Durable Objects gain access to a persistent KV Durable Object Storage API via the `DurableObjectStorage` interface and accessed by the `DurableObjectState::storage` property. This is frequently accessed via `this.ctx.storage` when the `ctx` parameter passed to the Durable Object constructor.
- Durable Object classes with the key-value storage backend can only use KV API.

Each method is implicitly wrapped inside a transaction, such that its results are atomic and isolated from all other storage operations, even when accessing multiple key-value pairs.

[**Radar**](/radar/) introduces HTTP Origins insights, providing visibility into the status of traffic between Cloudflare's global network and cloud-based origin infrastructure.

The new [`Origins`](/api/resources/radar/subresources/origins/) API provides provides the following endpoints:

- [`/origins`](/api/resources/radar/subresources/origins/methods/list/) - Lists all origins (cloud providers and associated regions).
- [`/origins/{origin}`](/api/resources/radar/subresources/origins/methods/get/) - Retrieves information about a specific origin (cloud provider).
- [`/origins/timeseries`](/api/resources/radar/subresources/origins/methods/timeseries/) - Retrieves normalized time series data for a specific origin, including the following metrics:
  - `REQUESTS`: Number of requests
  - `CONNECTION_FAILURES`: Number of connection failures
  - `RESPONSE_HEADER_RECEIVE_DURATION`: Duration of the response header receive
  - `TCP_HANDSHAKE_DURATION`: Duration of the TCP handshake
  - `TCP_RTT`: TCP round trip time
  - `TLS_HANDSHAKE_DURATION`: Duration of the TLS handshake
- [`/origins/summary`](/api/resources/radar/subresources/origins/methods/summary/) - Retrieves HTTP requests to origins summarized by a dimension.
- [`/origins/timeseries_groups`](/api/resources/radar/subresources/origins/methods/timeseries_groups/) - Retrieves timeseries data for HTTP requests to origins grouped by a dimension.

The following dimensions are available for the `summary` and `timeseries_groups` endpoints:

- `region`: Origin region
- `success_rate`: Success rate of requests (2XX versus 5XX response codes)
- `percentile`: Percentiles of metrics listed above

Additionally, the [`Annotations`](/api/resources/radar/subresources/annotations/) and [`Traffic Anomalies`](/api/resources/radar/subresources/traffic_anomalies/) APIs have been extended to support origin outages and anomalies, enabling automated detection and alerting for origin infrastructure issues.

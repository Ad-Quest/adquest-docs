BCC/Journaling deployment is a post-delivery type of deployment. Cloudflare analyzes emails after they reach the user's inbox. Every time you receive an email, your email provider will send a blind copy to Cloudflare for an analysis.

- Choose [BCC](/cloudflare-one/email-security/setup/post-delivery-deployment/bcc-journaling/bcc-setup/gmail-bcc-setup/gmail-bcc-setup/) if your email provider is Gmail.
- Choose [Journaling](/cloudflare-one/email-security/setup/post-delivery-deployment/bcc-journaling/journaling-setup/m365-journaling/) if your email provider is Microsoft 365.

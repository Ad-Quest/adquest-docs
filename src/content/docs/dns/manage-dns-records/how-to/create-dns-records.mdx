Consider the sections below for step-by-step instructions on managing DNS records at Cloudflare.

To better understand what DNS records are, refer to [Overview](/dns/manage-dns-records/). For context around common records you want to review when getting started at Cloudflare, refer to [review DNS records](/dns/zone-setups/full-setup/setup/#review-dns-records).

:::note
If your domain is added to Cloudflare by a hosting partner, manage your DNS records via the hosting partner.

## Basic operations

### Create DNS records

<Tabs syncKey="dashPlusAPI"> <TabItem label="Dashboard">

To create a DNS record in the dashboard:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **DNS Records** page.

   <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/:zone/dns/records" />

2. Select **Add record**.
3. Choose a record [**Type**](/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/dns-record-types/).
4. Complete the required fields, which vary per record. Particularly important fields (for some records) include:
   - **Proxy status**: For `A`, `AAAA`, and `CNAME` records, decide whether hostname traffic is <GlossaryTooltip term="proxy status" link="/dns/proxy-status/">proxied through Cloudflare</GlossaryTooltip>.
   - **TTL**: Short for [_Time to Live_](/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/ttl/), this field controls how long each record is valid and — as a result — how long it takes for record updates to reach your end users.
   - **Comment** and **Tag**: [Record attributes](/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/record-attributes/) meant for your reference.
5. Select **Save**.

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="API">

To create records with the API, use a [POST request](/api/resources/dns/subresources/records/methods/create/). For field definitions, select a record type under the request body specification.

For specific API examples, refer to [DNS record types](/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/dns-record-types/).

</TabItem> </Tabs>

### Edit DNS records

<Tabs syncKey="dashPlusAPI"> <TabItem label="Dashboard">

To edit DNS records in the dashboard:

2. On a specific record, select **Edit**.
3. Make any necessary changes.
4. Select **Save**.

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="API">

To update part of a record with the API, use a [PATCH request](/api/resources/dns/subresources/records/methods/edit/). If you want to overwrite the entire existing record, use a [PUT request](/api/resources/dns/subresources/records/methods/update/).

</TabItem> </Tabs>

## Use cases

### Update an origin IP address

If your hosting provider changes or your origin IP address changes, update the **Content** value of the relevant DNS records (usually `A` or `AAAA` records).

If you are not sure which IP address to use, refer to your hosting provider's documentation.

### Originless setups

If you need a placeholder address for an originless setup (also referred to as parked domain or redirect-only), you can use the reserved IPv6 address `100::` or the reserved IPv4 address `192.0.2.0` in a <GlossaryTooltip term="proxy status" link="/dns/proxy-status/">proxied</GlossaryTooltip> DNS record.

This allows you to route requests using products such as [Redirect Rules](/rules/url-forwarding/), [Page Rules](/rules/page-rules/), or [Workers](/workers/).

RealtimeKit recordings can be stopped in any of the following ways:

1. **Automatic Stop (Empty meeting)**: A RealtimeKit recording will automatically stop
   if the meeting has no participants for a duration of 1 minute or more. This
   wait time can be customized by contacting RealtimeKit's support team to configure a
   custom value for your app.
2. **Automatic Stop (maxSeconds elapsed)**: A recording will automatically stop
   when it reaches the duration specified by the `max_seconds` parameter passed
   while starting the recording, regardless of whether participants are present
   in the meeting. If this parameter is not passed, it defaults to 24 hours
   (86400 seconds).
3. **Using Stop Recording API**: A recording can also be stopped by passing the
   recording ID and `stop` action to the [Stop Recording API](/api/resources/realtime_kit/subresources/recordings/).

When a recording is stopped, it transitions to the `UPLOADING` state and then to the `UPLOADED` state after it has been transferred to RealtimeKit's storage and any external storage that has been set up.

Get your content updates into [AI Search](/ai-search/) faster and avoid a full rescan when you do not need it.

## Reindex individual files without a full sync

Updated a file or need to retry one that errored? When you know exactly which file changed, you can now [reindex it directly](/ai-search/configuration/indexing/#controls) instead of rescanning your entire data source.

Go to **Overview** > **Indexed Items** and select the sync icon next to any file to reindex it immediately.

## Crawl only the sitemap you need

By default, AI Search crawls all sitemaps listed in your `robots.txt`, up to the [maximum files per index limit](/ai-search/platform/limits-pricing/#limits). If your site has multiple sitemaps but you only want to index a specific set, you can now [specify a single sitemap URL](/ai-search/configuration/data-source/website/#sitemap) to limit what the crawler visits.

For example, if your `robots.txt` lists both `blog-sitemap.xml` and `docs-sitemap.xml`, you can specify just `https://example.com/docs-sitemap.xml` to index only your documentation.

Configure your selection anytime in **Settings** > **Parsing options** > **Specific sitemaps**, then trigger a sync to apply the changes.

The Cloudflare Vite plugin now integrates seamlessly [@vitejs/plugin-rsc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/tree/main/packages/plugin-rsc), the official Vite plugin for [React Server Components](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-components).

A `childEnvironments` option has been added to the plugin config to enable using multiple environments within a single Worker.
The parent environment can then import modules from a child environment in order to access a separate module graph.
For a typical RSC use case, the plugin might be configured as in the following example:

```ts title="vite.config.ts"
export default defineConfig({
	plugins: [
		cloudflare({
			viteEnvironment: {
				name: "rsc",
				childEnvironments: ["ssr"],
			},
		}),
	],
});
```

`@vitejs/plugin-rsc` provides the lower level functionality that frameworks, such as [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/how-to/react-server-components), build upon.
The GitHub repository includes a [basic Cloudflare example](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/tree/f066114c3e6bf18f5209ff3d3ef6bf1ab46d3866/packages/plugin-rsc/examples/starter-cf-single).

Traffic detections check incoming requests for malicious or potentially malicious activity. Each enabled detection provides one or more attributes classifying incoming requests. These attributes are available as filters in the [Security Analytics](/waf/analytics/security-analytics/) dashboard, and use can use them in rule expressions.

Once enabled, detections are always on, even if there are no security rules configured with the attributes that detections provide. This means that you can use detection results in [Security Analytics](/waf/analytics/security-analytics/) to identify traffic patterns and check for potentially malicious traffic. For example, you can analyze incoming traffic based on attack score, bot score, [content scan results](/waf/detections/malicious-uploads/), or the [presence of personally identifiable information (PII)](/waf/detections/firewall-for-ai/) in large language model (LLM) prompts.

Cloudflare currently provides the following detections for finding security threats in incoming requests:

:::note[Notes]

On Free plans, the leaked credentials detection is enabled by default, and no action is required.

Currently, you cannot manage the [bot score](/bots/concepts/bot-score/) and [attack score](/waf/detections/attack-score/) detections from the **Settings** page. Refer to the documentation of each feature for availability details.

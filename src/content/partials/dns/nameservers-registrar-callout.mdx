:::caution[Cloudflare Registrar]
If you acquired your domain from [Cloudflare Registrar](/registrar/), your domain already uses Cloudflare nameservers, automatically protecting and speeding up your content or services. If you need to update your nameservers to use a different DNS provider, you will have to [transfer your domain from Cloudflare](/registrar/account-options/transfer-out-from-cloudflare/).

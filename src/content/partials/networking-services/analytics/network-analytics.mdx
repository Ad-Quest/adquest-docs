Data is aggregated into time intervals that vary based on the selected zoom level. For example, a daily view shows 24-hour averages, which can flatten short-term traffic spikes. As a result, longer time intervals display lower peak bandwidth values compared to more granular views like five-minute intervals.

Refer to the [Network Analytics](/analytics/network-analytics/) documentation to learn more.

## Network traffic data filters

	<Markdown
	text={`
	Magic Transit customers can account for all traffic flows that enter Cloudflare's network, are blocked by DDoS rules or Magic Firewall, and leave Cloudflare's network. This visibility allows customers to track the total packets and bytes that traverse Cloudflare's network and are ultimately destined for their own network. It also provides increased visibility into any traffic flows that are unaccounted for.

{ (props.magicWord === "Magic WAN" || props.magicWord === "WAN Tunnels") && (

	<Markdown
	text={`
	Magic WAN customers have increased visibility into traffic flows across Cloudflare One products, including:

	- Traffic entering Cloudflare's network via WARP
	- Traffic leaving Cloudflare's network via WARP
	- Traffic leaving Cloudflare's network via Cloudflare Tunnel (\`cloudflared\`)

	`}
	inline={false}
	/>
  </>
  )
}

The complete list of filters includes:

- A list of your top tunnels by traffic volume.
- Traffic source and destination by traffic type, on-ramps and off-ramps, <GlossaryTooltip term="IP address">IP addresses</GlossaryTooltip>, and ports.
- Destination IP ranges and ASNs.
- Protocols and packet sizes.
- Samples of all GRE or IPsec tunnel traffic entering or leaving Cloudflare's network.
- Mitigations applied (such as DDoS and Magic Firewall) to traffic entering Cloudflare's network.

Refer to [Access Magic Tunnel traffic analytics](#access-magic-tunnel-traffic-analytics) below to learn how to access these filters.

## Access Magic Tunnel traffic analytics

1. Go to the **Network Analytics** page.

	<DashButton url="/?to=/:account/network-analytics" />

2. In the **All Traffic** tab, scroll to **Top Insights** to access network traffic filters. By default, the dashboard shows five items, but you can display up to 25 items at once. To change the number of items, select the drop-down menu.
3. (Optional) Hover over a traffic type. You can then choose to filter for that traffic, or exclude it from the results.
4. To adjust the scope of information displayed, scroll to **All traffic** > **Add filter**.
5. In the **New filter** popover, choose the data type from the left drop-down menu, an operator from the middle drop-down menu, and an action from the right drop-down menu. For example:

   ```txt
   <DESTINATION_TUNNELS> | _equals_ | <NAME_OF_YOUR_TUNNEL>
   ```

   This lets you examine traffic from specific Source tunnels and/or Destination tunnels.

## Feature notes

- For Magic Transit customers, `Non-Tunnel traffic` often represents traffic from the public Internet or traffic via [CNIs](/network-interconnect/).
- For Magic WAN / WAN tunnels customers, `Non-Tunnel traffic` refers to traffic outside GRE or IPsec tunnels. This can include traffic from:
  - [WARP](/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/warp/)
  - [CNIs](/network-interconnect/)
  - Traffic destined for the public Internet via [Gateway](/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/)
  - Traffic destined for applications behind [Cloudflare Tunnel](/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/)

The label `Non-Tunnel traffic` is a placeholder, and more specific labels will be applied to this category of traffic in the future.

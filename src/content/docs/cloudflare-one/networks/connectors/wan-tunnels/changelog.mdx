## 2025-02-14

**Sites feature available to all WAN Tunnels customers**

All WAN Tunnels customers now have full access to the WAN Tunnels sites feature. Customers can configure a WAN Tunnels site either with or without an Appliance.

## 2024-12-17

**Appliances configurable health checks**

Health check rate on Appliances IPsec tunnels are now configurable.

## 2024-12-17

**BGP support for Cloudflare Network Interconnect (CNI)**

WAN Tunnels customers can now establish BGP peering over Direct CNI circuits. Customers can now dynamically exchange routes and path availability status between their router device and the WAN Tunnels table.

## 2024-12-12

**LAN Policy improvements for the Appliances**

Appliances LAN Policy now supports unidirectional traffic flows and port-ranges.

## 2024-10-01

**Early access testing for BGP on CNI 2.0 circuits**

Customers can exchange routes dynamically with their Magic virtual network overlay via Direct CNI or Cloud CNI based connectivity.

## 2024-09-27

**Appliances sends WARP client traffic to Internet**

All Appliances now route WARP client traffic directly to the Internet, bypassing IPsec tunneling, to prevent double encapsulation of WARP traffic.

## 2024-07-17

**Updates to High Availability on the Appliances**

The High Availability feature on Appliances now supports additional failover conditions, DHCP lease syncing, and staggered upgrades.

## 2024-06-23

**ICMP support for traffic sourced from private IPs**

WAN Tunnels will now support ICMP traffic sourced from private IPs going to the Internet via Gateway.

## 2024-06-05

**Application based prioritization**

The Appliances can now prioritize traffic on a per-application basis.

## 2024-05-31

**WARP virtual IP addresses**

Customers using Gateway to filter traffic to WAN Tunnels destinations will now see traffic from Cloudflare egressing with WARP virtual IP addresses (CGNAT range), rather than public Cloudflare IP addresses. This simplifies configuration and improves visibility for customers.

## 2024-01-23

**Network segmentation**

You can define policies in your Appliance to either allow traffic to flow between your LANs without it leaving your local premises or to forward it via the Cloudflare network where you can add additional security features.

Magic Firewall now supports a new managed list of Cloudflare IP ranges. This list is available as an option when creating a Magic Firewall policy based on IP source/destination addresses.  When selecting "is in list" or "is not in list", the option "**Cloudflare IP Ranges**" will appear in the dropdown menu.

This list is based on the IPs listed in the Cloudflare [IP ranges](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/ips/).
Updates to this managed list are applied automatically.

Rate limiting policies (beta) allow you to manage incoming traffic to your network for specific locations.

This guide will teach you how to create a policy for when incoming packets match, and in cases where your rate exceeds a certain value (in packets or bits).

:::note
For Advanced Magic Firewall customers, rate limiting (beta) is available by request through the account team.

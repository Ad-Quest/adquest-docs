import { APIRequest, Render } from "~/components";

Use the [Create an account or zone ruleset](/api/resources/rulesets/methods/create/) operation to create a custom ruleset, making sure that you:

- Set the `kind` field to `custom`.
- Specify the name of the [phase](/ruleset-engine/reference/phases-list/) where you want to create the custom ruleset in the `phase` field.

<Render file="custom-ruleset-zone-limitation" product="ruleset-engine" />

## Example A - Custom ruleset at the account level

The following request creates a new custom ruleset at the account level. The response will include the ID of the new custom ruleset in the `id` field.

<APIRequest
	path="/accounts/{account_id}/rulesets"
	method="POST"
	json={{
		name: "Custom Ruleset 1",
		description: "My First Custom Ruleset (account)",
		kind: "custom",
		phase: "http_request_firewall_custom",
	}}
/>

```json output {3}
{
	"result": {
		"id": "f82ccda3d21f4a02825d3fe45b5e1c10",
		"name": "Custom Ruleset 1",
		"description": "My First Custom Ruleset (account)",
		"kind": "custom",
		"version": "1",
		"last_updated": "2025-08-09T10:27:30.636197Z",
		"phase": "http_request_firewall_custom"
	},
	"success": true,
	"errors": [],
	"messages": []
}
```

You can include a list of rules in the custom ruleset creation request. If you have not added any rules, refer to [Add rules to a custom ruleset](/ruleset-engine/custom-rulesets/add-rules-ruleset/) for more information.


## Example B - Custom ruleset at the zone level

The following request creates a new custom ruleset at the zone level. The response will include the ID of the new custom ruleset in the `id` field.

<APIRequest
	path="/zones/{zone_id}/rulesets"
	method="POST"
	json={{
		name: "Custom Ruleset 1",
		description: "My First Custom Ruleset (zone)",
		kind: "custom",
		phase: "http_request_firewall_custom",
	}}
/>

```json output {3}
{
	"result": {
		"id": "f82ccda3d21f4a02825d3fe45b5e1c10",
		"name": "Custom Ruleset 1",
		"description": "My First Custom Ruleset (zone)",
		"kind": "custom",
		"version": "1",
		"last_updated": "2025-08-09T10:27:30.636197Z",
		"phase": "http_request_firewall_custom"
	},
	"success": true,
	"errors": [],
	"messages": []
}
```

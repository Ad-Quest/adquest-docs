View a visual representation of your parsed Workflow code as a diagram on the Cloudflare dashboard.

The diagram illustrates your sequenced & parallel steps, conditionals, loops, and nested logic. To see the Workflow at a high level, view the diagram with loops and conditionals collapsed, or expand for a more detailed view.

Workflow diagrams are currently in beta for all Typescript and Javascript Workers. View your Workflows in the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers/workflows) to see their diagrams.

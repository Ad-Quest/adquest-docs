### Invalid submissions

A submission is invalid when:

- A submission has no EML file attached.
- A submission has been made with an incorrect file extension.
- A submission was made to the wrong team or user alias.

To ensure your submission is valid:

- Ensure your submission has a file attached with a `.eml` file extension.
- Ensure you configure the domain you are submitting emails for.
- Ensure policies are configured correctly.

To view invalid submissions:

1. Log in to [Cloudflare One](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/).
2. Select **Email Security** > **Reclassifications**.
3. Select **Invalid submissions**.

You can search by submission ID or submitted email.

You can filter based on **Date Range** and **Submitted by** (which will list emails that made the invalid submissions). Once you have configured your desired filters, select **Apply filters**.

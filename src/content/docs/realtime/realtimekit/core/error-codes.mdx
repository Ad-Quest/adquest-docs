## RealtimeKitClient

#### Error code: 0001

- **Error message**: Failed to initialize
- **Possible reason**: RealtimeKitClient is not getting initialized.
- **Possible solution**: Verify if you initialized the RealtimeKitClient correctly `await RealtimeKitClient.init({ ... })`.

#### Error code: 0002

- **Error message**: Failed to join room
- **Possible reason**: Indicates a problem with the RealtimeKitClient.
- **Possible solution**: The `join()` method is used to join a meeting room in RealtimeKit. Try calling this method again on the RealtimeKitClient:

await meeting.join();
```

Once the join room process completes, you'll see the `roomJoined` event is emitted on the `meeting.self` namespace.

#### Error code: 0003

- **Error message**: Failed to leave room
- **Possible reason**: Indicates a problem with the RealtimeKitClient.
- **Possible solution**: The `leave()` method is used to leave a meeting room in RealtimeKit. Try calling this method again on the RealtimeKitClient:

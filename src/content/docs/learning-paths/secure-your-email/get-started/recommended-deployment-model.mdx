While there are multiple deployment methods, the easiest way to get started with Email security is via the API deployment method.

The API deployment with Email security offers:

- Easy protection for complex email architectures, without requiring any change to mail flow operations.
- Agentless deployment for Microsoft 365.
- Office 365 directory integration to retrieve user and group information and prevent user impersonation.

Workers VPC uses the following account roles:

- `Connectivity Directory Read` to view Workers VPC Services and Tunnels.
- `Connectivity Directory Bind` to list/read services and bind them in Workers.
- `Connectivity Directory Admin` to create, update, and delete services.

For role definitions, refer to [Roles](/fundamentals/manage-members/roles/#account-scoped-roles).

If your roles were recently updated and commands are still failing, refresh Wrangler authentication:

```sh
npx wrangler logout
npx wrangler login
```

If you authenticate with an API token (`CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`), ensure the token belongs to a user with the required roles.

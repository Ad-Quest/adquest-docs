Start building agents that can remember context and make decisions. This guide walks you through creating your first agent and understanding how they work.

Agents maintain state across conversations and can execute workflows. Use them for customer support automation, personal assistants, or interactive experiences.

## What you will learn

Building with agents involves understanding a few core concepts:

- **State management**: How agents remember information across interactions.
- **Decision making**: How agents analyze requests and choose actions.
- **Tool integration**: How agents access external APIs and data sources.
- **Conversation flow**: How agents maintain context and personality.

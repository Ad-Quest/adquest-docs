By setting the value of the `cache` property to `no-cache`, you can force [Cloudflare's
cache](/workers/reference/how-the-cache-works/) to revalidate, its contents with the origin when
making subrequests from [Cloudflare Workers](/workers).

<TypeScriptExample filename="index.ts">
```ts
export default {
  async fetch(req, env, ctx): Promise<Response> {
		const request = new Request("https://cloudflare.com", { cache: 'no-cache'});
		const response = await fetch(request);
    return response;
  }
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Environment>
```
</TypeScriptExample>

When you set the value to `no-cache` on a subrequest made from a Worker, the Cloudflare Workers
runtime will force the cache to revalidate its data with the origin

This increases compatibility with NPM packages and JavaScript frameworks that rely on setting the
[`cache`](/workers/runtime-apis/request/#options) property, which is a cross-platform standard part
of the [`Request`](/workers/runtime-apis/request/) interface. Previously, if you set the `cache`
property on `Request` to `'no-cache'`, the Workers runtime threw an exception.

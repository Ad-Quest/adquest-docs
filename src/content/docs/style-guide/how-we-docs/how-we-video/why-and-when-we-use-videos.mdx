We believe video is a powerful tool that complements documentation to help users quickly grasp complex concepts and workflows. Not every piece of documentation should be a video and we should use it intentionally. Our goal is to apply video where it adds clarity, reduces cognitive load, and improves task completion to the original documentation.

We use video when it:
- Explains complex workflows
- Demonstrates UI-driven actions
- Reduces friction in onboarding and first-time use
- Clarifies abstract or conceptual topics

We don’t use video for:
- Reference material (API fields, parameters, limits)
- Frequently changing UI or experimental features
- Content that is faster to scan in text
- Information users need to copy, paste, or search precisely

Smart Shield acts as an intermediate caching layer between Cloudflare's content delivery network and your origin server, consolidating multiple requests from various locations into a single request. Combined with [connection reuse](/smart-shield/concepts/connection-reuse/), this approach significantly reduces origin load while improving website and application performance.

## End a session from your backend

### Remove all participants with the API

Use the [Kick all participants](/api/resources/realtime_kit/subresources/active-session/methods/kick_all_participants/) API method to remove all participants from an active session for a meeting.

<APIRequest
	path="/accounts/{account_id}/realtime/kit/{app_id}/meetings/{meeting_id}/active-session/kick-all"
	method="POST"
/>

### Listen for session end events with webhooks

Register a webhook that subscribes to `meeting.ended`. RealtimeKit sends this event when the session ends.
You can use it to trigger backend workflows, such as sending a notification, generating a report, or updating session records in your database.

<APIRequest
	path="/accounts/{account_id}/realtime/kit/{app_id}/webhooks"
	method="POST"
	json={{
		name: "Session ended webhook",
		url: "<YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL>",
		events: ["meeting.ended"],
	}}
/>

For IPsec tunnels, the value you need to specify depends on how your network is set up. The MSS clamping value is lower than for GRE tunnels because the physical interface sees IPsec-encrypted [packets](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-a-packet/), not TCP packets, and MSS clamping does not apply to those.

- **Magic Transit ingress-only traffic (DSR):**

  - **On your edge router transit ports**: Set the TCP MSS clamp to 1,436 bytes maximum.
  - **On any IPsec/GRE tunnels with third parties on your Magic Transit prefix**: On the internal tunnel interface (most likely on a separate firewall behind the GRE-terminating router) to reduce its current value by 140 bytes.

- **Magic Transit ingress + egress traffic:**

  - **On your edge router**: Apply this on your Magic Transit IPsec tunnel internal interface (that is, where the Magic Transit egress traffic will traverse). Your devices may do this automatically once the tunnel is configured, but it depends on your devices. Set the TCP MSS clamp to 1,360 bytes maximum.
  - **On any IPsec/GRE tunnels with third parties on your Magic Transit prefix**: On the internal tunnel interface (most likely on a separate firewall behind the IPsec-terminating device in your premises) to reduce its current value by 140 bytes.

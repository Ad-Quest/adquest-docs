title: Notes and other notation types

---

When adding a note to a page, always use this special note formatting. There are three types of formatted notes: `note`, `caution`, and `tip`.

Here is some additional information about notes:
- The color of the note depends on the type of note: `note` is blue, `caution` is yellow, and `tip` is purple.
- For every note type, the header text is optional.
- All note types can contain text and additional formatting like lists, code blocks, and images.

To learn how notes fit into our content strategy, refer to [Notes/tips/warnings](/style-guide/documentation-content-strategy/component-attributes/notes-tips-warnings/).

## Note

Use Note for small additions or when you need to provide extra context that is not essential to the main content.

If you do not provide a header, this aside will default to `Note`.

```mdx
:::note[Header]
Hello, world!
:::
```

:::note[Header]
Hello, world!
:::

## Caution/Warning

Use Caution to highlight actions that could cause issues for a user.

If you do not provide a header, this aside will default to `Warning`.

```mdx
:::caution[Feature conflict]
If you use feature A and feature B together, your configuration will not work.
:::
```

:::caution[Feature conflict]
If you use feature A and feature B together, your configuration will not work.
:::

## Tip

Use Tip to share best practices or opinionated use cases that do not fit into the main documentation.

If you do not provide a header, this aside will default to `Tip`.

```mdx
:::tip[Best practice]
Cloudflare recommends you use [1.1.1.1](/1.1.1.1/) as your DNS resolver.
:::
```

:::tip[Best practice]
Cloudflare recommends you use [1.1.1.1](/1.1.1.1/) as your DNS resolver.

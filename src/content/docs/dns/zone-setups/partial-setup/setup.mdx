:::note
A CNAME setup (partial) is only available to customers on a Business or Enterprise plan.
Partial setups are not supported on Cloudflare Registrar domains.

## Before you begin

<Steps>

1. Create a Cloudflare account and add your domain.
2. Choose **Business** or **Enterprise** as your plan.
3. If you are onboarding a new domain to Cloudflare, ignore the instructions to change your nameservers.
4. (Recommended) Plan for SSL/TLS certificates:

   If you are only using [Universal SSL](/ssl/edge-certificates/universal-ssl/) prior to converting your zone, a certificate will be provisioned for your subdomains only after each of the respective DNS records ([step 3](#3-add-dns-records) below) are [proxied](/dns/proxy-status/). Refer to [Enable Universal SSL](/ssl/edge-certificates/universal-ssl/enable-universal-ssl/#partial-dns-setup) for details.

   If your domain is sensitive to downtime, instead of using Universal SSL, consider using an [advanced certificate](/ssl/edge-certificates/advanced-certificate-manager/) with [delegated DCV](/ssl/edge-certificates/changing-dcv-method/methods/delegated-dcv/#setup).

</Steps>

## 1. Convert your zone and review DNS records


<Tabs syncKey="dashPlusAPI"> <TabItem label="Dashboard">

:::caution[Make sure you have the correct plan]
Make sure your zone is on the Business or Enterprise plan. If you have Free or Pro, the options mentioned below will not be displayed.
:::

<Steps>
1. On the **Overview** page, select **Convert to CNAME DNS Setup**.
2. Select **Convert** to confirm.
3. Save the information from the **Verification TXT Record**. If you lose the information, you can also access it on the [**DNS Records**](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/dns/records) page, under **Verification TXT Record**.
4. Make sure that you have all the DNS records (A, AAAA, or CNAME) for subdomains that you want to proxy through Cloudflare.

</Steps>

</TabItem> <TabItem label="API">

If you are adding a zone for the first time via API you can add it directly with a `type` of `partial`, without converting it.

<APIRequest
  path="/zones"
  method="POST"
  json={{
    "name": "example.com",
    "account": {
      "id": "YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID"
    },
    "type": "partial"
  }}
/>

</TabItem> </Tabs>

## 2. Verify ownership for your domain

## 3. Add DNS records

<Steps>

1. At your authoritative DNS provider:
   1. Create CNAME records pointing to `{your-hostname}.cdn.cloudflare.net` for every hostname you wish to proxy through Cloudflare.

   <Details header="Example CNAME record at authoritative DNS provider">

   The CNAME record for `www.example.com` would be:

   ```txt
   www.example.com CNAME www.example.com.cdn.cloudflare.net
   ```

   </Details>
2. Remove any previously existing A, AAAA, or CNAME records referencing the hostnames you want to proxy through Cloudflare. For these hostnames, leave only the records pointing to `{your-hostname}.cdn.cloudflare.net`.

2. Repeat this process for each subdomain that should be proxied to Cloudflare.

</Steps>

## Other record types

If you are preparing a conversion from CNAME setup (partial) to primary setup (full), or if you have a more specific use case, you can use the [Create DNS Record](/api/resources/dns/subresources/records/methods/create/) API endpoint to create DNS records of any supported type.

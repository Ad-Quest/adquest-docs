AI Crawl Control metrics have been enhanced with new views, improved filtering, and better data visualization.

![AI Crawl Control path patterns](~/assets/images/ai-crawl-control/ai-crawl-control-path-patterns.png)

**Path pattern grouping**

- In the **Metrics** tab > **Most popular paths** table, use the new **Patterns** tab that groups requests by URI pattern (`/blog/*`, `/api/v1/*`, `/docs/*`) to identify which site areas crawlers target most. Refer to the screenshot above.

**Enhanced referral analytics**

- Destination patterns show which site areas receive AI-driven referral traffic.
- In the **Metrics** tab, a new **Referrals over time** chart shows trends by operator or source.

**Data transfer metrics**

- In the **Metrics** tab > **Allowed requests over time** chart, toggle **Bytes** to show bandwidth consumption.
- In the **Crawlers** tab, a new **Bytes Transferred** column shows bandwidth per crawler.

**Image exports**

- Export charts and tables as images for reports and presentations.

Cloudflare's API now supports rate limiting headers using the pattern developed by the [IETF draft on rate limiting](https://ietf-wg-httpapi.github.io/ratelimit-headers/draft-ietf-httpapi-ratelimit-headers.html). This allows API consumers to know how many more calls are left until the rate limit is reached, as well as how long you will need to wait until more capacity is available. 

Our SDKs automatically work with these new headers, backing off when rate limits are approached. There is no action required for users of the latest Cloudflare SDKs to take advantage of this. 

As always, if you need any help with rate limits, please contact Support. 

### Changes
#### New Headers

**Headers that are always returned:**
- X-RateLimit-Limit: Total Number of requests the caller can make
- X-RateLimit-Remaining: Number of requests before Rate Limit kicks in

**Returned only when a rate limit has been reached (error code: 429):**
- Retry-After: Number of Seconds until more capacity is available, rounded up
- X-RateLimit-Reset: RFC 1123 Formatted Date as to when more capacity is available

#### SDK Back offs
- All SDKs will automatically respond to the headers, instituting a backoff when limits are approached. 

### GraphQL and Edge APIs
These new headers and back offs are only available for Cloudflare REST APIs, and will not affect GraphQL.

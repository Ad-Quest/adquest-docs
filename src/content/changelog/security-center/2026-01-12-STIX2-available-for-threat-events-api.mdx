We are excited to announce that **Cloudflare Threat Events** now supports the **STIX2 (Structured Threat Information Expression)** format. This was a highly requested feature designed to streamline how security teams consume and act upon our threat intelligence.

By adopting this industry-standard format, you can now integrate Cloudflare's threat events data more effectively into your existing security ecosystem.

### Key benefits

- Eliminate the need for custom parsers, as STIX2 allows for "out of the box" ingestion into major **Threat Intel Platforms (TIPs)**, **SIEMs**, and **SOAR** tools.

- STIX2 provides a standardized way to represent relationships between indicators, sightings, and threat actors, giving your analysts a clearer picture of the threat landscape.

For technical details on how to query events using this format, please refer to our [Threat Events API Documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/cloudforce_one/subresources/threat_events/methods/list/).

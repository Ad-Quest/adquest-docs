Enterprise customers can leverage dedicated egress[^1] IPs for layer 7 [WAF](/waf/) and <GlossaryTooltip term="content delivery network (CDN)">CDN</GlossaryTooltip> services, as well as [Spectrum](/spectrum/). The egress IPs are reserved exclusively for your account so that you can increase your origin security by only allowing traffic from a small list of IP addresses.

Dedicated CDN Egress IPs was formerly known as Cloudflare Aegis ([release blog post](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-aegis/)).

## Benefits

With Dedicated CDN Egress IPs, you can:

* Lock down your network firewall to only allow traffic from your dedicated IPs.
* Use [Cloudflare Access and CNI](/smart-shield/configuration/dedicated-egress-ips/other-products/#access-and-cni) to secure your applications without installing software or customizing code on your server.
* Ensure only authorized [Workers](/smart-shield/configuration/dedicated-egress-ips/other-products/#workers) can access your origin services.

## Scope

You can assign Dedicated CDN Egress IPs to single or multiple Cloudflare zones, and across different Cloudflare accounts.

Dedicated CDN Egress IPs are included within [BGP advertisement over CNI](/network-interconnect/).

Each dedicated egress pool can consist of either IPs from a [BYOIP prefix](/byoip/) or Cloudflare-leased IPs. A single dedicated egress pool cannot contain both BYOIPs and leased IPs.

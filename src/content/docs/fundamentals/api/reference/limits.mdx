## Rate limiting headers

The following headers are returned when calling REST APIs:

- `ratelimit-limit`: The total number of requests a caller can make.
- `ratelimit-remaining`: The number of remaining requests before the rate limit takes effect.
- `retry-after`: The number of seconds, rounded up, until more capacity is available.
- `ratelimit-reset`: The `RFC 1123` formatted date when more capacity is available.

Cloudflare's SDKs will also automatically work with the headers and back off in response to rate limits.

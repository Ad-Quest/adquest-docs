You can now use the `HAVING` clause and `LIKE` pattern matching operators in [Workers Analytics Engine](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/analytics-engine/).

Workers Analytics Engine allows you to ingest and store high-cardinality data at scale and query your data through a simple SQL API.

## Filtering using `HAVING`

The `HAVING` clause complements the `WHERE` clause by enabling you to filter groups based on aggregate values. While `WHERE` filters rows before aggregation, `HAVING` filters groups after aggregation is complete.

You can use `HAVING` to filter groups where the average exceeds a threshold:

```sql
SELECT
    blob1 AS probe_name,
    avg(double1) AS average_temp
FROM temperature_readings
GROUP BY probe_name
HAVING average_temp > 10
```

You can also filter groups based on aggregates such as the number of items in the group:

```sql
SELECT
    blob1 AS probe_name,
    count() AS num_readings
FROM temperature_readings
GROUP BY probe_name
HAVING num_readings > 100
```

## Pattern matching using `LIKE`

The new pattern matching operators enable you to search for strings that match specific patterns using wildcard characters:

- `LIKE` - case-sensitive pattern matching
- `NOT LIKE` - case-sensitive pattern exclusion
- `ILIKE` - case-insensitive pattern matching
- `NOT ILIKE` - case-insensitive pattern exclusion

Pattern matching supports two wildcard characters: `%` (matches zero or more characters) and `_` (matches exactly one character).

You can match strings starting with a prefix:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM logs
WHERE blob1 LIKE 'error%'
```

You can also match file extensions (case-insensitive):

```sql
SELECT *
FROM requests
WHERE blob2 ILIKE '%.jpg'
```

Another example is excluding strings containing specific text:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM events
WHERE blob3 NOT ILIKE '%debug%'
```

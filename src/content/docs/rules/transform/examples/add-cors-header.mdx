import { Example } from "~/components";

The following response header transform rule adds a header named `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` with a static wildcard value (`*`) to the HTTP response:

<Example>

Text in **Expression Editor**:

```txt
(http.host eq "<YOUR_HOSTNAME>")
```

Selected operation under **Modify response header**: _Set static_

**Header name**: `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`

**Value**: `*`

</Example>

You can also use an expression similar to the following to apply the CORS header to several specific hostnames:

```txt
(http.host in {"<YOUR_HOSTNAME_1>" "<YOUR_HOSTNAME_2>"})
```

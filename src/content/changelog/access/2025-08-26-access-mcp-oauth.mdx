[Access self-hosted applications](/cloudflare-one/applications/configure-apps/mcp-servers/linked-apps/) now support OAuth for MCP server authentication. This allows Cloudflare to delegate access from any self-hosted application to an MCP server via OAuth.

The OAuth access token authorizes the MCP server to make requests to your self-hosted applications on behalf of the user, using the user's specific permissions and scopes.

For example, your organization may wish to deploy an MCP server that helps employees interact with internal applications. You can configure Access policies to ensure that only authorized users can access those applications, either directly or by using an MCP client.

The MSS value depends on how your network is set up.

- **On your edge router**: Apply the clamp to the GRE tunnel internal interface (meaning where the egress traffic will traverse). Set the MSS clamp to 1,436 bytes. Your devices may do this automatically once the tunnel is configured, but it depends on your devices.

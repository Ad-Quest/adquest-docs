productName: AI Crawl Control
entries:
  - term: robots.txt
    general_definition: |-
      A text file which lists pages in your website that are off-limits for bots. Well-behaved bots respect this file, but some bots may violate it. You can enforce `robots.txt` with Cloudflare WAF custom rules.

  - term: Merchant of Record
    general_definition: |-
      The entity who facilitates "buying and selling". For pay per crawl, Cloudflare is the merchant of record.

  - term: AI crawler
    general_definition: |-
      A bot which scrapes content from websites in support of an AI model, including by scraping content for indexing, retrieval augmented generation, or training.

  - term: In-band pricing
    general_definition: |-
      A pricing model where pricing information is transmitted within the same communication channel as the content itself. In Pay Per Crawl, in-band pricing means the price is included in the HTTP response headers (`crawler-price`) alongside the actual content, rather than being retrieved from a separate system or API call. When custom pricing is enabled, Cloudflare sets the `cf-pay-per-crawl` header to `pricing=in-band`, indicating that the origin server or Worker can dynamically set prices by including a `crawler-price` header in the response.

  - term: Operator
    general_definition: |-
      The company or organization that owns and operates an AI crawler. Examples include OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, ByteDance, Anthropic, and Meta. In AI Crawl Control, crawlers are grouped by their operators.

  - term: Referrals
    general_definition: |-
      Traffic referred to your website by AI services, identified by the referrer URL and whether it is owned by an AI operator.

    title: RealtimeKit Web Core 1.2.3
    description: |-
      **Fixes**

      - Fixed an issue where users who joined a meeting with audio and video disabled and then initiated tab screen sharing would experience SDP corruption upon stopping the screen share, preventing subsequent actions such as enabling audio or video.
      
        Error thrown:
        ```text
        InvalidAccessError: Failed to execute 'setRemoteDescription' on 'RTCPeerConnection': Failed to set remote answer sdp: Failed to set remote audio description send parameters for m-section with mid='<N>'
        ```
      - Fixed an issue where awaiting `RealtimeKitClient.initMedia` did not return media tracks

        Example usage:
        ```ts
        const media = await RealtimeKitClient.initMedia({
          video : true,
          audio: true,
        });

        const { videoTrack, audioTrack } = media;
        ```
 
      - Fixed an issue where an undefined variable caused `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'getValue')` in media retrieval due to a race condition.

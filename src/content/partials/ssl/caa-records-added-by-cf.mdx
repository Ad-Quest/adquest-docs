Cloudflare adds CAA records automatically in the following situations:

- When you have [Universal SSL](/ssl/edge-certificates/universal-ssl/) and add any CAA records to your zone.
- When you have [advanced certificates](/ssl/edge-certificates/advanced-certificate-manager/) and add any CAA records to your zone.

These records make sure Cloudflare can still issue Universal certificates on your behalf.

:::note[Subdomain zones caveat]
CAA records are inherited. This means that, if you are using a [subdomain setup](/dns/zone-setups/subdomain-setup/) -  with `subdomain.example.com` on Cloudflare but `example.com` on a different DNS provider -, you should make sure that the parent domain (`example.com`) either has CAA records that allow [Cloudflare's partner CAs](/ssl/reference/certificate-authorities/), or has no CAA records at all.
:::

If Cloudflare has automatically added CAA records on your behalf, these records will not appear in the Cloudflare dashboard. However, if you run a command line query using `dig`, you can see any existing CAA records, including those added by Cloudflare (replacing `example.com` with your own domain on Cloudflare):

```bash
➜  ~ dig example.com caa +short

# CAA records added by Google Trust Services
0 issue "pki.goog; cansignhttpexchanges=yes"
0 issuewild "pki.goog; cansignhttpexchanges=yes"

# CAA records added by Let's Encrypt
0 issue "letsencrypt.org"
0 issuewild "letsencrypt.org"

# CAA records added by SSL.com
0 issue "ssl.com"
0 issuewild "ssl.com"

# CAA records added by Sectigo
0 issue "sectigo.com"
0 issuewild "sectigo.com"
```

:::note
This list is not exhaustive, and other CAs might be added or removed for operational reasons.

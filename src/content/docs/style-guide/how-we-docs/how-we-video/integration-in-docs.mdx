Our goal is to integrate video directly into the documentation so it accelerates the user experience and learning experience, not for videos to exist in a separate silo. 


## Embeding locations
- Doc pages: We embed videos directly in the relevant pages. This gives users a comprehensive learning experience with visual context and accurate technical details.
- [Video hub](https://developers.cloudflare.com/videos/page): For learners who prefer a video-first experience, we maintain a dedicated page for videos.
- [Resources](https://developers.cloudflare.com/resources/): Video is a core content type in our system. You can filter specifically for videos in the resources page.

## Chapters

We add time-stamped chapters to our videos to make relevant information more accessible by users and searchable by machines.

Chapters allow users to:
- **Skip ahead**: Jump directly to the specific information you need.
- **Find answers**: Search engines and LLMs can index these chapters, making it easier to retrieve specific visual segments when a user asks a technical question.

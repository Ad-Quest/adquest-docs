In January 2025, we announced the launch of the new Terraform v5 Provider. We greatly appreciate the proactive engagement and valuable feedback from the Cloudflare community following the v5 release. In response, we've established a consistent and rapid [2-3 week cadence](https://github.com/cloudflare/terraform-provider-cloudflare/issues/5774) for releasing targeted improvements, demonstrating our commitment to stability and reliability.

With the help of the community, we have a growing number of resources that we have marked as [stable](https://github.com/cloudflare/terraform-provider-cloudflare/issues/6237), with that list continuing to grow with every release. The most used [resources](https://github.com/cloudflare/terraform-provider-cloudflare/issues/6237) are on track to be stable by the end of March 2026, when we will also be releasing a new migration tool to you migrate from v4 to v5 with ease.

Thank you for continuing to raise issues. They make our provider stronger and help us build products that reflect your needs.

This release includes bug fixes, the stabilization of even more popular resources, and more.

<Details header="Hostname format restrictions">
- **Character limit:** Must be less than 255 characters.
- **Supported wildcards:** A single wildcard (`*`) is allowed, and it must represent a full DNS label.
			Examples: `*.internal.local`, `foo.*.internal.local`
- **Unsupported wildcards:** The following wildcard formats are not supported:
		- Partial wildcards such as `*-dev.internal.local` or `dev-*.internal.local`.
		- Wildcards in the middle of a label, such as `foo*bar.internal.local`.
		- Multiple wildcards in the hostname, such as `*.*.internal.local`.
- **Wildcard trimming**: Leading wildcards (`*`) are trimmed off and an implicit dot (`.`) is assumed. For example, `*.internal.local` is saved as `internal.local` but will match all subdomains at the wildcard level (covers `foo.internal.local` but not `foo.bar.internal.local`).
- **Dot trimming:** Leading and ending dots (`.`) are allowed but trimmed off.

Cloudflare Workflows now automatically generates visual diagrams from your code

Your Workflow is parsed to provide a visual map of the Workflow structure, allowing you to:

- Understand how steps connect and execute
- Visualize loops and nested logic
- Follow branching paths for conditional logic

![Example diagram](~/assets/images/changelog/workflows/2026-02-03-workflows-diagram.png)

You can collapse loops and nested logic to see the high-level flow, or expand them to see every step.

Workflow diagrams are available in beta for all JavaScript and TypeScript Workflows. Find your Workflows in the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers/workflows) to see their diagrams.

Magic WAN can work together with <a href="/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/">Cloudflare Tunnel</a> to provide easy access between your networks and applications.

By default, <a href={props.gatewayURL}>Cloudflare Gateway</a> proxies and filters TCP, UDP, and ICMP traffic routed through Magic WAN tunnels and destined to routes behind Cloudflare Tunnel.

## Route evaluation and precedence

Cloudflare evaluates <a href="/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/private-net/cloudflared/">private network routes</a> together across the Cloudflare Tunnel and Magic Networking routing tables. If traffic matches either a Cloudflare Tunnel route (in any virtual network) or a Magic Networking route, the matched route determines the next hop.

When a destination IP matches both a Cloudflare Tunnel private network route and a Magic Networking route, Cloudflare Tunnel takes precedence. This happens whenever a `cloudflared` tunnel Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) matches a packet, regardless of prefix length. For example, a `cloudflared` tunnel with prefix `10.1.2.0/24` takes precedence over a static route configured to `10.1.2.4/32`, and Cloudflare sends packets over the tunnel instead of a GRE tunnel.

For complex deployments where you need overlapping routes in both Cloudflare Tunnel and Magic Networking, consult your Solutions Engineering team for guidance.

For more information about private network routes with `cloudflared`, refer to <a href="/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/private-net/cloudflared/">Connect with cloudflared</a>.

## Test `cloudflared` tunnel integration

To verify that a `cloudflared` tunnel works correctly with your Magic WAN connection:

1. From a host behind your customer premises equipment, open a browser.
2. Browse to an IP address or hostname that is reachable through a Cloudflare Tunnel private network route, such as the example destination `10.1.2.3`.
3. Confirm that the application loads as expected. If it does, Cloudflare Tunnel is handling the traffic as configured.

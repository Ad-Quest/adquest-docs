releaseNotes: |-
  This release contains minor fixes and improvements.

  **Changes and improvements**
  - The [Local Domain Fallback](/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/warp/configure-warp/route-traffic/local-domains/) feature has been fixed for devices running WARP client version 2025.4.929.0 and newer. Previously, these devices could experience failures with Local Domain Fallback unless a fallback server was explicitly configured. This configuration is no longer a requirement for the feature to function correctly.
  - [Proxy mode](/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/warp/configure-warp/warp-modes/#proxy-mode) now supports transparent HTTP proxying in addition to CONNECT-based proxying.

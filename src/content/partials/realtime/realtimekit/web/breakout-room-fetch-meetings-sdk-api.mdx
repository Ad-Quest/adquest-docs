```js
const breakoutRoomsInfo = await meeting.connectedMeetings.getConnectedMeetings();
```

`breakoutRoomsInfo` is an object containing the list of breakout rooms and their participants, along with details of the parent meeting.

This data can be used to display the list of breakout rooms & participants in the UI. This API refetches the list of breakout rooms & participants, therefore can be considered the source of truth for breakout rooms & participants. It is advised to call this API, to get the latest list of breakout rooms & participants, if a lot of changes are in progress.

You can also listen to `stateUpdate` event to get the latest list of breakout rooms & participants, as they are updated in real-time.

```js
meeting.connectedMeetings.on("stateUpdate", ({meetings, parentMeeting}) => {
  console.log("stateUpdate", {meetings, parentMeeting});

  // Alternatively, you can access the meetings and parentMeeting from the connectedMeetings object
  console.log("Meetings List", meeting.connectedMeetings.meetings);
  console.log("Parent Meeting", meeting.connectedMeetings.parentMeeting);
});
```

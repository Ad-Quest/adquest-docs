SSH with [Cloudflare Access for Infrastructure](/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/use-cases/ssh/ssh-infrastructure-access/) allows you to use short-lived SSH certificates to eliminate SSH key management and reduce security risks associated with lost or stolen keys.

Previously, users had to generate this certificate by using the [Cloudflare API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/) directly. With this update, you can now create and manage this certificate in the [Cloudflare One dashboard](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com) from the **Access controls** > **Service credentials** page.

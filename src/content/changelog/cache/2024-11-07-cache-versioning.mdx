You can now stage and test cache configurations before deploying them to production. Versioned environments let you safely validate cache rules, purge operations, and configuration changes without affecting live traffic.

## How it works

With versioned environments, you can:

1. **Create staging versions** of your cache configuration.
2. **Test cache rules** in a non-production environment.
3. **Purge staged content** independently from production.
4. **Validate changes** before promoting to production.

This capability integrates with Cloudflare's broader [versioning system](/version-management/), allowing you to manage cache configurations alongside other zone settings.

## Benefits

- **Risk-free testing**: Validate configuration changes without impacting production.
- **Independent purging**: Clear staging cache without affecting live content.
- **Deployment confidence**: Catch issues before they reach end users.
- **Team collaboration**: Multiple team members can work on different versions.

## Get started

To get started, refer to the [version management documentation](/version-management/).

:::note[Important limitation]

Cache Reserve is only supported for your production environment. Staged environments can use standard cache functionality, but Cache Reserve persistence is limited to production deployments.

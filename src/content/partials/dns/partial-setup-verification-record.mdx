Add the **Verification TXT Record** at your authoritative DNS provider. Cloudflare will verify the TXT record and send a confirmation email. This can take up to a few hours.

<Details header="Example verification record">

A verification record for `example.com` might be:

| Type | Name                            | Content             |
| ---- | ------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| TXT  | `cloudflare-verify.example.com` | 966215192-518620144 |

</Details>

:::note

If your authoritative DNS provider automatically appends DNS record `name` fields with your domain, make sure to only insert `cloudflare-verify` as the record name. Otherwise, it may result in an incorrect record name, such as `cloudflare-verify.example.com.example.com`.

After creating the record, you can use this [Dig Web Interface link](https://digwebinterface.com/?type=TXT&ns=auth&nameservers=) to search (`dig`) for `cloudflare-verify.<YOUR DOMAIN>` and validate if it is working.

:::

The verification record must remain in place for as long as your domain is active on the partial setup on Cloudflare.

If your organization has multiple Cloudflare accounts, also consider using zone holds to have more control over [domain ownership](/dns/zone-setups/partial-setup/#domain-ownership).

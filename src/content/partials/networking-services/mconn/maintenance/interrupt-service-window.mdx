The Interrupt window defines when {props.productName} can update its systems. When {props.productName} is updating, this may result in an interruption to existing connections. Set up a time window that minimizes disruption to your sites.

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Configuration* page.

<DashButton url="/?to=/:account/magic-wan/configuration" />

2. In the **Connectors** tab, select the Connector for which you want to set up the update window > **Edit**.
3. In **Interrupt window**, select the most appropriate time for the Connector to update its systems:
   - **Timezone**: Select the time zone for the Connector to update.
   - **Start time**: Choose an hour for the Connector to start updating. Cloudflare recommends you choose an hour when there is minimal activity in your network, to avoid potential disruptions.
   - **Duration**: Duration indicates the time window during which the Connector is scheduled to update. For example, if you configure your Connector to update at `22:00` and specify a **Duration** of `4 hours`, the Connector will attempt to update within the four-hour period following `22:00`.

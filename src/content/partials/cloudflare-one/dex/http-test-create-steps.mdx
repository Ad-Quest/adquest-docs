To set up an HTTP test for an application:

1. In [Cloudflare One](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/), go to **Insights** > **Digital experience**.
2. Select the **Tests** tab.
3. Select **Add a Test**.
4. Fill in the following fields:
   - **Name**: Enter any name for the test.
   - **Target**: Enter the URL of the website or application that you want to test (for example, `https://jira.site.com`). Both public and private hostnames are supported. If testing a private hostname, ensure that the domain is on your [local domain fallback](/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/warp/configure-warp/route-traffic/local-domains/) list.
   - **Source device profiles**: (Optional) Select the [WARP device profiles](/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/warp/configure-warp/device-profiles/) that you want to run the test on. If no profiles are selected, the test will run on all supported devices connected to your Zero Trust organization.
   - **Test type**: Select _HTTP Get_.
   - **Test frequency**: Specify how often the test will run. Input a minute value between 5 and 60.
5. Select **Add test**.
6. After the test is created and running, you can [view the results](/cloudflare-one/insights/dex/tests/view-results/) of your test.

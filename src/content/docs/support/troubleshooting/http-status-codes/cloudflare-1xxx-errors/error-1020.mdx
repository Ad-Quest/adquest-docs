## Error 1020: Access denied

This error indicates that access to the website is denied by a Cloudflare firewall rule.

### Common cause

A client or browser is blocked by a Cloudflare customer's Firewall Rules (deprecated).

### Resolution

If you are not the website owner, provide the website owner with a screenshot of the `1020` error message you received.

If you are the website owner:

<Tabs syncKey="dashNewNav"> <TabItem label="New dashboard" icon="rocket">

1. Retrieve a screenshot of the 1020 error from your customer.
2. Search the [Security Events log](/waf/analytics/security-events/) (available at **Security** > **Analytics**, in the **Events** tab) for the [Ray ID](/fundamentals/reference/cloudflare-ray-id/) or client IP address from the visitor's 1020 error message.

   <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/:zone/security/analytics" />

   :::note
   Convert the UTC timestamp of the `1020` error to your local timezone when searching in the Security Events log.
   :::

3. Assess the cause of the block and either update the Firewall Rule or allow the visitor's IP address in [IP Access Rules](/waf/tools/ip-access-rules/).

Use IPsec logs to troubleshoot issues with your IPsec tunnels during the key-exchange phase of the IPsec handshake. Configure a logpush job to forward these logs to your preferred storage service for analysis.

## Set up an IPsec logpush job

1. Go to the **Logpush** page.

	<DashButton url="/?to=/:account/logs" />

2. Select **Create a Logpush job**.
3. Select **IPsec logs** as your dataset.

Refer to the [Logpush documentation](/logs/logpush/) for more information about features, including the [available fields](/logs/logpush/logpush-job/datasets/account/ipsec_logs/) in the dataset.

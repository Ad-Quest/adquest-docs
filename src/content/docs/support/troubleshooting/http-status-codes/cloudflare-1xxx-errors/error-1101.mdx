## Error 1101: Rendering error

This error indicates a rendering issue.

### Common cause

This error typically occurs when a Cloudflare Worker encounters a runtime JavaScript exception.

### Debugging

To identify the specific JavaScript exception:

   - Undefined variables or functions
   - Type errors
   - Promise rejections
   - Network request failures
3. Test the [Worker locally](/workers/development-testing/#local-development) with sample requests to reproduce the error.
4. Refer to [Workers error handling](/workers/observability/errors/) for more details on debugging Workers.

### Resolution

Fix the JavaScript exception in your Workers code. If you need assistance, [provide appropriate issue details](/support/contacting-cloudflare-support/) to Cloudflare Support, including:

- The Ray ID from the error page

Cloudflare One allows your team to connect to your applications using their GitHub login. You do not need to have a GitHub organization to use the integration.

## Set up GitHub Access

To configure GitHub access in both GitHub and Cloudflare One:

1. Log in to [GitHub](https://github.com/).

2. Go to your account > **Settings** > **Developer Settings**.

3. In **Developer Settings**, select **OAuth Apps** and select **New OAuth app**.

4. On the **Register a new OAuth application** page, enter an **Application name**. Your users will see this application name on the login page.

5. In the **Homepage URL** field, enter your team domain:

   ```txt
   https://<your-team-name>.cloudflareaccess.com
   ```

   <Render file="find-team-name" product="cloudflare-one" />

6. In the GitHub **Authorization callback URL** field, enter the following URL:

   ```txt
   https://<your-team-name>.cloudflareaccess.com/cdn-cgi/access/callback
   ```

7. Select **Register application**.

8. Make note of the **Client ID**.

9. Select **Generate a new client secret** and copy the client secret to a safe place.

10. In [Cloudflare One](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com), go to **Integrations** > **Identity providers**.

11. Select **Add new identity provider** and select **GitHub**.

12. In **App ID**, enter the **Client ID** obtained from GitHub (refer to step 8).

13. In **Client secret**, enter the **Client secret** obtained from GitHub (refer to step 9).

14. Select **Save**.

15. Select **Finish setup** to launch a GitHub authorization page. You will be asked to grant the following permissions to Cloudflare Access:
	- Organizations and teams (read-only)
	- Email addresses (read-only)

16. Select **Authorize**.

To test that your connection is working, go to [Cloudflare One](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com) > **Integrations** > **Identity providers** and select **Test** next to your GitHub login method. If you have GitHub two-factor authentication enabled, you will need to first login to GitHub directly and return to Access.

:::note[Troubleshooting organization policies]

When using a GitHub organization policy, if a user joins the required organization after a failed login attempt, they will remain blocked. To fix this, they must revoke the application's access in their GitHub settings and log in again to update their permissions.

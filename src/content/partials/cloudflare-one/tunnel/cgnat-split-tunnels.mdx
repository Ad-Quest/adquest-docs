Ensure that traffic to your [device IPs](/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/warp/configure-warp/device-ips/) goes through the WARP tunnel. For example, if your devices use the default `100.96.0.0/12` range:

    <Tabs> <TabItem label="Exclude IPs and domains">
		If using Split Tunnels in **Exclude** mode:
			1. Delete `100.64.0.0/10` from the list.
			2. We recommend [adding back the IPs](/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/private-net/cloudflared/connect-cidr/#3-route-private-network-ips-through-warp) that are not being used for Cloudflare One services. For example, if you plan to use {props.feature} alongside [Gateway host selectors](/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/egress-policies/host-selectors/), add routes to exclude the following IP addresses:

				- `100.64.0.0/12`
				- `100.81.0.0/16`
				- `100.82.0.0/15`
				- `100.84.0.0/14`
				- `100.88.0.0/13`
				- `100.112.0.0/12`

    </TabItem> <TabItem label="Include IPs and domains">
		If using Split Tunnels in **Include** mode:

		1. Add the required [Zero Trust domains](/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/warp/configure-warp/route-traffic/split-tunnels/#cloudflare-zero-trust-domains) or [IP addresses](/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/warp/configure-warp/route-traffic/split-tunnels/#cloudflare-zero-trust-ip-addresses) to your Split Tunnel include list.
		2. [Add a route](/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/warp/configure-warp/route-traffic/split-tunnels/#add-a-route) to include `100.96.0.0/12`.

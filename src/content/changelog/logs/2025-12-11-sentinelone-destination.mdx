Cloudflare Logpush now supports **SentinelOne** as a native destination.

Logs from Cloudflare can be sent to [SentinelOne AI SIEM](https://www.sentinelone.com/) via [Logpush](/logs/logpush/). The destination can be configured through the Logpush UI in the Cloudflare dashboard or by using the [Logpush API](/api/resources/logpush/subresources/jobs/).

For more information, refer to the [Destination Configuration](/logs/logpush/logpush-job/enable-destinations/sentinelone/) documentation.

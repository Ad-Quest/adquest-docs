This feature requires an Enterprise plan with a paid add-on.

The Cloudflare Sensitive Data Detection managed ruleset helps identify data leaks generated by your origin servers. Its rules run on the body of the response looking for patterns of common sensitive data, including:

- [Personally identifiable information](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/privacy/what-is-pii/) (PII) — For example, passport numbers.
- Financial information — For example, credit card numbers.
- Secrets — For example, API keys.

Turning on Cloudflare Sensitive Data Detection will not introduce additional latency, since the detection occurs outside the response path. For this reason, rules are always deployed with the _Log_ action (you cannot block a response that was already sent), providing you with visibility on the sensitive data leaving your origin servers.

:::note
Some rules in the Cloudflare Sensitive Data Detection managed ruleset are disabled by default, to prevent false positives and a large number of logged events. You should review the PII and sensitive data relevant to your application and turn on the appropriate rules in the managed ruleset, according to the instructions in the following sections.
:::

## Additional remarks

When turned on, Cloudflare Sensitive Data Detection will check all responses sent to visitors (according to your custom filter expression, if defined), including responses from cache and responses handled by [Workers](/workers/).

The detection will handle text, HTML, JSON, and XML content in the response up to 1 MB.

Currently, Cloudflare Sensitive Data Detection does not support [matched payload logging](/waf/managed-rules/payload-logging/).

## Deploy the Cloudflare Sensitive Data Detection ruleset {/* deploy-in-the-dashboard */}

:::note
Requires an Enterprise plan with a paid add-on.
:::

<Tabs syncKey="dashNewNav"> <TabItem label="Old dashboard">

<Steps>

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), and select your account and domain.
2. Go to **Security** > **Sensitive data**.
3. Turn on **Cloudflare Sensitive Data Detection** to deploy the ruleset.

</Steps>

</TabItem> <TabItem label="New dashboard" icon="rocket">

<Steps>

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the Security **Settings** page.

   <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/:zone/security/settings" />

2. (Optional) Filter by **Web application exploits**.
3. Turn on **Sensitive data detection** to deploy the ruleset.

</Steps>

</TabItem> </Tabs>

## Configure in the dashboard

You can configure (or override) the Cloudflare Sensitive Data Detection ruleset at several levels:

- [Ruleset level](#ruleset-level-configuration)
- [Tag level](#tag-level-configuration)
- [Rule level](#rule-level-configuration)

More specific configurations (rule and tag level) have greater priority than less specific configurations (ruleset level). Refer to [Override a managed ruleset](/ruleset-engine/managed-rulesets/override-managed-ruleset/) in the Ruleset Engine documentation for more information.

### Ruleset-level configuration

You can configure (or override) the following Cloudflare Sensitive Data Detection setting in the Cloudflare dashboard:

- **Scope**: When you define a custom filter expression for the scope, the Cloudflare Sensitive Data Detection ruleset applies only to a subset of the incoming requests. By default, a managed ruleset deployed in the dashboard applies to all incoming traffic.

Once you have [deployed the Cloudflare Sensitive Data Detection ruleset](#deploy-in-the-dashboard), do the following to configure it in the dashboard:

<Tabs syncKey="dashNewNav"> <TabItem label="Old dashboard">

<Steps>

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), and select your account and domain.

2. Go to **Security** > **Sensitive Data**.

3. Next to **Cloudflare Sensitive Data Detection**, select the three dots > **Edit**.

4. Select **Edit scope** and decide if you want to apply the managed ruleset to all incoming requests or to a subset. If you select **Custom filter expression**, define the filter expression that will determine which requests the Cloudflare Sensitive Data Detection ruleset will apply to.

5. Select **Next**, and then select **Save**.

</Steps>

</TabItem> <TabItem label="New dashboard" icon="rocket">

<Steps>

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the Security **Settings** page.

   <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/:zone/security/settings" />

2. (Optional) Filter by **Web application exploits**.
3. For **Sensitive data detection**, select **Configured ruleset: \<SCOPE>** to edit the ruleset scope.<br/>
   Decide if you want to apply the managed ruleset to all incoming requests (global scope) or to a subset.

4. If you selected **Custom filter expression**, define the filter expression that will determine which requests the Cloudflare Sensitive Data Detection ruleset will apply to.

5. Select **Next**, and then select **Save**.

</Steps>

</TabItem> </Tabs>

### Tag-level configuration

You can configure (or override) the following setting in the dashboard for rules tagged with at least one of the selected tags:

- **Rule status**: Sets the rule status for all the rules with the selected tags.

:::note
Setting the rule status for specific tags affects all current and future rules with the tags you selected.
:::

Once you have [deployed the Cloudflare Sensitive Data Detection ruleset](#deploy-in-the-dashboard), do the following to configure rules with specific tags in the dashboard:

<Tabs syncKey="dashNewNav"> <TabItem label="Old dashboard">

<Render file="managed-rules-browse-zone-sdd" product="waf" />

<Render
	file="managed-ruleset-configure-rules-by-tag"
	product="waf"
	params={{
		rulesetName: "Cloudflare Sensitive Data Detection",
	}}
/>

</TabItem> <TabItem label="New dashboard" icon="rocket">

<Render file="managed-rules-browse-zone-sdd-new-nav" product="waf" />

<Render
	file="managed-ruleset-configure-rules-by-tag"
	product="waf"
	params={{
		rulesetName: "Cloudflare Sensitive Data Detection",
	}}
/>

</TabItem> </Tabs>

### Rule-level configuration

You can configure (or override) the following setting in the dashboard for the selected rules:

- **Rule status**: Sets the status (enabled or disabled) of a single rule or, if you select multiple rules, for the selected rules.

Once you have [deployed the Cloudflare Sensitive Data Detection ruleset](#deploy-in-the-dashboard), do the following to configure individual ruleset rules in the dashboard:

<Tabs syncKey="dashNewNav"> <TabItem label="Old dashboard">

<Render file="managed-rules-browse-zone-sdd" product="waf" />

<Render
	file="managed-ruleset-configure-individual-rules"
	product="waf"
	params={{
		rulesetName: "Cloudflare Sensitive Data Detection",
	}}
/>

</TabItem> <TabItem label="New dashboard" icon="rocket">

<Render file="managed-rules-browse-zone-sdd-new-nav" product="waf" />

<Render
	file="managed-ruleset-configure-individual-rules"
	product="waf"
	params={{
		rulesetName: "Cloudflare Sensitive Data Detection",
	}}
/>

</TabItem> </Tabs>

## Configure via API

To deploy the Cloudflare Sensitive Data Detection ruleset for a given zone using the API, create a rule with `execute` action in the [entry point ruleset](/ruleset-engine/about/rulesets/#entry-point-ruleset) for the `http_response_firewall_managed` phase.

### Example

This example deploys the Cloudflare Sensitive Data Detection ruleset to the `http_response_firewall_managed` phase of a given zone (`$ZONE_ID`) by creating a rule that executes the managed ruleset. The rules in the managed ruleset are executed for all incoming requests.

## Review detected leaks

To check for any data leaks detected by Cloudflare Sensitive Data Detection, you can do the following:

- Regularly check [Security Events](/waf/analytics/security-events/) for any events generated by the managed ruleset.
- Configure [WAF alerts](/waf/reference/alerts/) to be alerted of any spike of WAF events. For the Advanced Security Events Alert, you can filter by one or more domains on Enterprise plans and by the `Data Loss Protection` service to receive specific alerts about Sensitive Data Detection.

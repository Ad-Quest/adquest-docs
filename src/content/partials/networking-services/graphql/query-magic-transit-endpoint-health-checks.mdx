Use the [GraphQL Analytics API](/analytics/graphql-api/) to query endpoint health check results for your account. The `magicEndpointHealthCheckAdaptiveGroups` dataset returns probe results aggregated by the dimensions and time interval you specify.

Send all GraphQL queries as HTTP `POST` requests to `https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/graphql`.

### Prerequisites

You need the following to query endpoint health check data:

- Your [account ID](/fundamentals/account/find-account-and-zone-ids/).
- An [API token](/fundamentals/api/get-started/create-token/) with `Account > Account Analytics > Read` permissions. For details, refer to [Configure an Analytics API token](/analytics/graphql-api/getting-started/authentication/api-token-auth/).

### Query parameters

The following parameters are some of the most common ones in the `filter` object:

| Parameter | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| `date_geq` | Start date for the query in `YYYY-MM-DD` format (for example, `2026-01-01`). When used with a date-based truncation dimension, returns results from this date onward. You can also use a full ISO 8601 timestamp (for example, `2026-01-01T00:00:00Z`). |
| `date_leq` | _(Optional)_ End date for the query. Uses the same format as `date_geq`. |
| `datetime_geq` | _(Optional)_ Start timestamp in ISO 8601 format (for example, `2026-01-01T00:00:00Z`). Use instead of `date_geq` for time-based truncation dimensions. |
| `datetime_leq` | _(Optional)_ End timestamp in ISO 8601 format. |
| `limit` | Maximum number of result groups to return. |

You can also filter on any dimension listed in the [Available dimensions](#available-dimensions) table. Append an operator suffix to the dimension name to create a filter — for example, `endpoint_in` to filter by a list of endpoints, or `checkType_neq` to exclude a specific check type. Using a dimension name without a suffix filters for equality. For the full list of supported operators, refer to [Filtering](/analytics/graphql-api/features/filtering/).

### Available dimensions

You can query the following dimensions in the `dimensions` field:

| Dimension | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| `checkId` | The unique ID of the configured health check. |
| `checkType` | The type of health check (for example, `icmp`). |
| `endpoint` | The IP address of the endpoint being checked. |
| `name` | The name assigned to the health check when configured (may be empty if not set). |
| `date` | Event timestamp truncated to the day. |
| `datetime` | Full event timestamp. |
| `datetimeMinute` | Event timestamp truncated to the minute. |
| `datetimeFiveMinutes` | Event timestamp truncated to five-minute intervals. |
| `datetimeFifteenMinutes` | Event timestamp truncated to 15-minute intervals. |
| `datetimeHalfOfHour` | Event timestamp truncated to 30-minute intervals. |
| `datetimeHour` | Event timestamp truncated to the hour. |

### Available metrics

| Metric | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| `count` | Total number of health check events in the group. |
| `sum.total` | Total number of health check probes sent. |
| `sum.failures` | Number of failed health check probes. |
| `avg.lossPercentage` | Average calculated loss percentage (0-100). |

### API call

The following example queries endpoint health check results for a specific account, returning probe counts aggregated in five-minute intervals. Replace `<ACCOUNT_ID>` with your [account ID](/fundamentals/account/find-account-and-zone-ids/) and `<API_TOKEN>` with your [API token](/analytics/graphql-api/getting-started/authentication/api-token-auth/).

```bash
echo '{ "query":
  "query GetEndpointHealthCheckResults($accountTag: string, $datetimeStart: string) {
    viewer {
      accounts(filter: {accountTag: $accountTag}) {
        magicEndpointHealthCheckAdaptiveGroups(
          filter: {
            datetime_geq: $datetimeStart
          }
          limit: 10
        ) {
          count
          dimensions {
            checkId
            checkType
            endpoint
            datetimeFiveMinutes
          }
          sum {
            failures
            total
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }",
  "variables": {
    "accountTag": "<ACCOUNT_ID>",
    "datetimeStart": "2026-01-21T00:00:00Z"
  }
}' | tr -d '\n' | curl --silent \
https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/graphql \
--header "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>" \
--header "Accept: application/json" \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data @-
```

Pipe the output to `jq` to format the JSON response for easier reading:

```bash
... | curl --silent \
https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/graphql \
--header "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>" \
--header "Accept: application/json" \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data @- | jq .
```

          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  "errors": null
}
```

In this response, `sum.total` is the number of probes sent during the interval and `sum.failures` is the number that did not receive a reply. A `failures` value of `0` indicates the endpoint was fully reachable during that period.

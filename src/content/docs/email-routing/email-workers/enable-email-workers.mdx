Follow these steps to enable and add your first Email Worker. If you have never used Cloudflare Workers before, Cloudflare will create a subdomain for you, and assign you to the Workers [free pricing plan](/workers/platform/pricing/).

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Email Routing** page.

   <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/:zone/email/routing" />

2. Select **Get started**.
3. In **Custom address**, enter the custom email address you want to use (for example, `my-new-email`).
4. In **Destination**, choose the email address or Email Worker you want your emails to be forwarded to — for example, `your-name@gmail.com`. You can only choose a destination address you have already verified. To add a new destination address, refer to [Destination addresses](#destination-addresses).
5. Select **Create and continue**.
6. Verify your destination address and select **Continue**.
7. Configure your DNS records and select **Add records and enable**.

You have successfully created your Email Worker. In the Email Worker’s card, select the **route** field to expand it and check the routes associated with the Worker.

Magic WAN now supports Automatic Return Routing (ARR), allowing customers to configure Magic on-ramps (IPsec/GRE/CNI) to learn the return path for traffic flows without requiring static routes.

Key benefits:

- **Route-less mode**: Static or dynamic routes are optional when using ARR.
- **Overlapping IP space support**: Traffic originating from customer sites can use overlapping private IP ranges.
- **Symmetric routing**: Return traffic is guaranteed to use the same connection as the original on-ramp.

This feature is currently in beta and requires the new Unified Routing mode (beta).

For configuration details, refer to [Configure Automatic Return Routing](/magic-wan/configuration/manually/how-to/configure-routes/#configure-automatic-return-routing-beta).

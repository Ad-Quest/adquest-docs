An HTTP test measures the following data:

| Data                 | Description                                                                                                                                                             |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Resource fetch time  | Total time of all steps of the request, measured from [`startTime` to `responseEnd`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance_API/Resource_timing). |
| Server response time | Round-trip time for the device to receive a response from the target.                                                                                                   |
| DNS response time    | Round-trip time for the DNS query to resolve.                                                                                                                           |
| HTTP status codes    | [Status code](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status) returned by the target.                                                               |

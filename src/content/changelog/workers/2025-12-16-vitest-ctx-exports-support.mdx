The [`@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers`](/workers/testing/vitest-integration/) package now supports the [`ctx.exports` API](/workers/runtime-apis/context/#exports), allowing you to access your Worker's top-level exports during tests.

You can access `ctx.exports` in unit tests by calling `createExecutionContext()`:

```ts
import { createExecutionContext } from "cloudflare:test";
import { it, expect } from "vitest";

it("can access ctx.exports", async () => {
  const ctx = createExecutionContext();
  const result = await ctx.exports.MyEntryPoint.myMethod();
  expect(result).toBe("expected value");
});
```

Alternatively, you can import `exports` directly from `cloudflare:workers`:

```ts
import { exports } from "cloudflare:workers";
import { it, expect } from "vitest";

it("can access imported exports", async () => {
  const result = await exports.MyEntryPoint.myMethod();
  expect(result).toBe("expected value");
});
```

See the [context-exports fixture](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/tree/main/fixtures/vitest-pool-workers-examples/context-exports) for a complete example.

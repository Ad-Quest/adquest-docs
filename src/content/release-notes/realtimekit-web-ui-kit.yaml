    title: RealtimeKit Web UI Kit 1.1.0
    description: |-
      **Compatibility:** Works best with RealtimeKit Web Core 1.2.4 or later.

      **Features**

      - Chat message operations (edit, delete, pin) are now available to all participants.
      - Chat pagination with infinite scroll for improved performance in meetings with high message volume.
      - Pinned messages are now displayed in a dedicated view for easy access.
      - Added `overrides` prop support on `rtk-meeting` and `rtk-ui-provider` for easier UI customization. Available overrides include:
        - `disablePrivateChat` - Disable private chat functionality.
        - `disableEmojiPicker` - Hide emoji picker in chat component.
        ```tsx
        <RtkMeeting meeting={meeting} overrides={{
          disablePrivateChat: true,
          disableEmojiPicker: true
        }} />
        ```

      **New components**

      - `rtk-chat-header` - Header component with pinned messages and private chat selector.
      - `rtk-pinned-message-selector` - Displays all pinned messages with paginated infinite scroll.
      - `rtk-chat-selector` - Switch between public chat and private chats with specific participants.

      **Component enhancements**

      - `rtk-chat-composer-view` now accepts `isSending` prop to display sender messages on the right and other messages on the left with different colors.
      - `rtk-chat-messages-ui-paginated` now accepts `privateChatRecipient` prop for displaying paginated private chat messages.
      - `rtk-chat-messages-ui-paginated` now emits `editMessage`, `deleteMessage`, and `pinMessage` events for message operations.
      - `rtk-menu-item` and `rtk-menu-list` now accept `menuVariant` prop for different color schemes based on user actions.
      - `rtk-message-view` now accepts `isEdited`, `isSelf`, `messageType`, and `pinned` props for appropriate message rendering.
      - Added automatic scrolling to new messages.

      **Breaking changes**

      Removed non-operational chat channel components to streamline the SDK. `rtk-chat` remains fully operational.
      - Removed `rtk-channel-creator`.
      - Removed `rtk-channel-header`.
      - Removed `rtk-channel-details`.
      - Removed `rtk-channel-selector-ui`.
      - Removed `rtk-channel-selector-view`.
      - `rtk-chat-composer-ui` no longer accepts `channelId` prop.
      - `rtk-chat` no longer accepts `disablePrivateChat` prop. Use preset configuration instead, or pass as override:
        ```tsx
        <RtkMeeting meeting={meeting} overrides={{disablePrivateChat: true}} />
        ```

      **Deprecations**

      - `rtk-chat-composer-ui` is deprecated due to scalability limitations and lack of pagination support.

      **Known limitations**

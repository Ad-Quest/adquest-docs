This page explains Cloudflare’s approach to integrating video into Cloudflare’s docs, covering topics from production to discoverability and long-term maintenance in a way that’s accurate, scalable, and AI-ready.

Our goal is to share practical workflows, tooling choices, and lessons learned to the open-source community so others can adopt or adapt the work without completely reinventing it.

We hope you learn from the topics below. As always, [submit an issue](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-docs/issues/new) if you find something inaccurate or unclear.

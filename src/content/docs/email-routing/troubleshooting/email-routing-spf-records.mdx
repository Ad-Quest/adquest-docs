Having multiple [sender policy framework (SPF) records](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-spf-record/) on your account is not allowed, and will prevent Email Routing from working properly. If your account has multiple SPF records, follow these steps to solve the issue:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Email Routing** page. Email Routing will warn you that you have multiple SPF records.

   <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/:zone/email/routing" />

2. Under **View DNS records**, select **Fix records**.
3. Delete the incorrect SPF record.

You should now have your SPF records correctly configured. If you are unsure of which SPF record to delete:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Email Routing** page. Email Routing will warn you that you have multiple SPF records.

   <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/:zone/email/routing" />

2. Under **View DNS records**, select **Fix records**.
3. Delete all SPF records.
4. Select **Add records and enable**.

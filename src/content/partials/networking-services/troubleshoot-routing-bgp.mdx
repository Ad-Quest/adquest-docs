This guide helps you diagnose and resolve common routing and BGP issues with {props.productName}. These issues can affect traffic delivery, cause unexpected latency, or result in connectivity loss.

## Quick diagnostic checklist

If you are experiencing routing or BGP issues, check these items first:

<Markdown text={`
1. **BGP session state**: Verify session is **Established**, not stuck in **Connect** or **Active**.
2. **Firewall rules**: Ensure TCP port \`179\` is permitted bidirectionally between your router and Cloudflare.${props.magicWord === "Magic Transit" ? `
3. **Prefix advertisement status**: Confirm prefixes show **Advertised** in the dashboard, not **Withdrawn** or **Approved**.
4. **Route propagation timing**: Allow two to five minutes for changes to propagate globally. Cloudflare propagates changes within minutes, but has no control over how quickly external ISPs refresh their BGP tables.` : ""}
5. **Tunnel or CNI health**: Check that underlying connectivity is healthy. Degraded tunnels affect route priority.
6. **Static route conflicts**: Static routes take precedence over BGP routes at equal priority.

When a route is withdrawn, Internet networks perform BGP path hunting. They search for alternative paths before converging on the new routing state. This behavior is amplified by:

- Cloudflare's global anycast network and extensive peering relationships
- The Minimum Route Advertisement Interval (MRAI), typically 30 seconds per iteration
- Multiple Tier-1 networks needing to converge independently

During path hunting, traffic may be routed suboptimally or dropped entirely.

	<Aside type="note">
	When failing traffic off Cloudflare, use the same-length prefix strategy. Advertise the identical prefix from your alternate provider before withdrawing from Cloudflare. This prevents path hunting because BGP does not need to search for alternative routes.

## Resolve common issues

### BGP session not establishing

This section covers BGP peering sessions (beta) between your network and Cloudflare, established over [CNI](/network-interconnect/) or tunnels. { props.magicWord === "Magic Transit" && (<Markdown text={` These sessions are separate from how Cloudflare advertises your prefixes to the Internet, which is covered in [Route propagation timing](#route-propagation-timing).`} />)}

#### Symptoms

- BGP session never reaches **Established** state
- No routes being advertised or received
- Router logs show repeated connection attempts

#### BGP session states

| State | Meaning | Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Established** | Session up, exchanging routes | Normal operation |
| **Active** | Attempting to initiate connection | Check firewall rules, verify neighbor IP |
| **Connect** | TCP connection in progress | Check port `179` access, verify peering IP |
| **Idle** | Session down, no connection attempts | Check configuration, verify BGP is enabled |

#### Solution

1. Verify your firewall permits TCP port `179` bidirectionally between your router and the Cloudflare peering address.
2. Confirm the neighbor IP matches the Cloudflare-provided peering address exactly.
3. Verify your ASN configuration matches the dashboard settings. Only eBGP is supported, so your ASN must differ from the Cloudflare account ASN.
4. If using MD5 authentication, verify the password matches on both sides.

1. **Wait for propagation**: Allow up to five minutes for full global propagation. Changes propagate across Cloudflare quickly but external networks update at varying speeds.
2. **Verify return path routing**: Ensure your network has routes to send return traffic back through Cloudflare for egress configurations. For ingress-only or direct server return configurations, route return traffic through your tunnels.
3. **Check external visibility**: Use BGP looking glass tools such as [bgp.he.net](https://bgp.he.net) or [RIPE RIS](https://ris.ripe.net/) to confirm your prefix is visible from external networks.
4. **Verify RPKI configuration**: If you use Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI), confirm your Route Origin Authorization (ROA) records match your prefix and the ASN configuration in Cloudflare.

	<Markdown
	text={`
This is BGP path hunting behavior. When Cloudflare withdraws your prefix, Internet networks search for alternative paths. Convergence typically takes two to five minutes but can extend beyond 11 minutes. During this period, traffic may:

- Route to Cloudflare through cached paths at ISPs
- Loop between Tier-1 providers that have not yet converged
- Be dropped before reaching your network
	`}

	/>

	<AnchorHeading title="Solution" depth={4} />
	<Markdown
	text={`
Follow the safe prefix withdrawal procedure:

1. **Before withdrawal**: Advertise the same prefix (identical prefix length) from your alternate provider. This gives BGP an immediate alternative path.
2. **Optional - deprioritize Cloudflare**: Add AS prepends to Cloudflare's route to make it less preferred, allowing traffic to shift gradually.
3. **Withdraw from Cloudflare**: Request prefix withdrawal through the API or dashboard.
4. **Wait for convergence**: Allow at least 15 minutes before considering the migration complete.

Using identical prefix lengths from both Cloudflare and your ISP prevents path hunting. Networks immediately have an alternative route available.

### Unexpected traffic routing or latency

#### Symptoms

- Traffic from specific regions routed through distant data centers
- Higher than expected latency for regional users
- Traffic not using the closest tunnel or CNI

#### Causes

- Tunnel health degradation causing route deprioritization
- Regional route scoping misconfiguration
- BGP route priorities not set as expected
- Static routes overriding BGP routes

#### Solution

1. **Check tunnel health**: Degraded tunnels have 500,000 added to their route priority. Down tunnels have 1,000,000 added. Traffic shifts to healthier paths, which may be in different regions. Refer to <a href={props.tunnelHealthLink}>Troubleshoot tunnel health</a> for diagnostic steps.

2. **Review route priorities**: Lower priority values indicate higher preference. Verify your routes have the expected priority configuration.

   - Default BGP route priority: `100`
   - Static routes at priority `100` take precedence over BGP routes at `100`

3. **Check regional scoping**: If you use region-scoped routes, ensure all regions have route coverage. Traffic arriving at a region without a matching route is dropped.

4. **Use Network Analytics**: Review traffic patterns to identify where traffic is landing and which paths it follows. Refer to <a href={props.networkAnalyticsLink}>Network Analytics</a> for usage instructions.

### CNI link failures

#### Symptoms

- CNI shows down in dashboard
- BGP session over CNI drops
- Traffic fails over to tunnels or alternate CNIs

#### CNI issue layers

CNI issues can occur at multiple layers:

| Issue type | Impact | What to check |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Physical link down | All traffic over that CNI affected | Light levels, cross-connect status |
| BGP session down | Dynamic routes withdrawn | BGP neighbor state on your router |
| Prefixes withdrawn | Specific routes unavailable | BGP advertised and received routes |

A healthy physical link can still have BGP issues. A healthy BGP session can exist while specific prefixes are withdrawn.

#### Solution

**Check physical layer (your side):**

:::note
In the case of interconnects provisioned by third parties, you may need to request that your provider carry these steps out.
:::

1. Verify the interface is administratively up on your router.
2. Check optical light levels (Tx/Rx dBm). Abnormal readings indicate fiber or transceiver issues.
3. If light levels are low or absent on your receive side, contact your data center to verify cross-connect status.

**Check BGP session:**

1. Verify BGP neighbor state on your router shows **Established**.
2. Check for MD5 authentication mismatches if authentication is configured.
3. Review BGP logs for error messages indicating why the session may have dropped.

**Check for maintenance:**

1. Review [Cloudflare Status](https://www.cloudflarestatus.com/) for scheduled maintenance affecting your CNI location.
2. Some maintenance events may temporarily affect CNI connectivity even when marked as non-disruptive.

Refer to [Network Interconnect](/network-interconnect/) for CNI configuration and setup information.

### Static and BGP route conflicts

#### Symptoms

- BGP routes not being used despite being learned
- Traffic not following expected BGP path
- Route changes not taking effect as expected

#### Cause

Cloudflare prefers static routes when static and BGP routes share the same prefix and priority. This ensures manually configured routes take precedence unless explicitly deprioritized.

#### Solution

Adjust route priorities based on your preference:

- **To prefer BGP routes**: Set static route priority to a higher number (for example, `150` or `200`). Higher numbers indicate lower preference.
- **To prefer static routes**: Keep static route priority at or below `100`. BGP routes default to priority `100`.

| Route type | Prefix | Priority | Selected |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Static | `10.0.0.0/24` | `100` | Yes (static wins ties) |
| BGP | `10.0.0.0/24` | `100` | No |

To make the BGP route preferred in this example, change the static route priority to `150` or higher, or remove the static route entirely.

Refer to <a href={props.trafficSteeringLink}>Route prioritization</a> for detailed information on how priorities work.

## CNI, tunnel, and BGP health

Understanding the relationship between these components helps diagnose routing issues:

| Component | What it monitors | Impact when unhealthy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CNI health** | Physical or virtual interconnect link status | BGP session may drop. All traffic over that CNI is affected. |
| **Tunnel health** | Logical GRE or IPsec tunnel through health check probes | Route priority penalized. Traffic steers to healthier tunnels. |
| **BGP session** | Control plane connectivity for dynamic routing | Dynamic routes withdrawn. Static routes remain unaffected. |

A healthy CNI can have an unhealthy tunnel if health check probes are blocked or misconfigured. BGP routes can be withdrawn even when the underlying physical link is operational.

## Gather information for support

If you have worked through this guide and still experience routing issues, gather the following information before contacting Cloudflare support.

### Required information

1. **Account ID** and affected prefix(es), tunnel name(s), or CNI identifier(s)
2. **Timestamps** (in UTC) when the issue occurred
3. **BGP configuration details:**
   - Your ASN and Cloudflare peering ASN
   - Neighbor IP addresses
   - Sanitized router configuration (remove passwords and keys)
4. **Current state information:**
   - BGP session state from your router
   - Dashboard screenshots showing prefix, route, or tunnel status

### Helpful diagnostic data

{ props.magicWord === "Magic Transit" && (<Markdown text={`- **External BGP visibility**: Results from looking glass tools showing your prefix`} inline={false} />)}
- **Router logs**: BGP neighbor logs covering the incident timeframe
- **Traceroute results**: From affected source networks to your prefix
- **For CNI issues**: Optical light level readings from your equipment

### Router diagnostic commands

Collect output from these commands (syntax varies by vendor):

```sh
# Show BGP neighbor status
show bgp neighbors

# Show BGP summary
show bgp ipv4 unicast summary

# Show specific prefix in BGP table
show bgp ipv4 unicast <YOUR_PREFIX>

# Show interface status (for CNI)
show interface <YOUR_INTERFACE_NAME>

# Show received and advertised routes
show bgp ipv4 unicast neighbors <YOUR_NEIGHBOR_IP> routes
show bgp ipv4 unicast neighbors <YOUR_NEIGHBOR_IP> advertised-routes
```

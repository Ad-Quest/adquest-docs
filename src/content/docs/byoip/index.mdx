With **Bringing Your Own IPs** (BYOIP), Cloudflare announces your IPs in all our locations. Use your IPs with [Magic Transit](/magic-transit/), [Spectrum](/spectrum/), [CDN services](/cache/), or Gateway [DNS locations](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/agentless/dns/locations/) and [dedicated egress IPs](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/egress-policies/dedicated-egress-ips/).

Learn how to [get started](/byoip/get-started/).

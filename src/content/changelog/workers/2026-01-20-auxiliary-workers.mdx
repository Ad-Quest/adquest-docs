Auxiliary Workers are now fully supported when using full-stack frameworks, such as [React Router](/workers/framework-guides/web-apps/react-router/) and [TanStack Start](/workers/framework-guides/web-apps/tanstack-start/), that integrate with the [Cloudflare Vite plugin](/workers/vite-plugin/reference/api/).
They are included alongside the framework's build output in the build output directory.
Note that this feature requires Vite 7 or above.

Auxiliary Workers are additional Workers that can be called via [service bindings](/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/service-bindings/) from your main (entry) Worker.
They are defined in the plugin config, as in the example below:

```ts title="vite.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import { tanstackStart } from "@tanstack/react-start/plugin/vite";
import { cloudflare } from "@cloudflare/vite-plugin";

export default defineConfig({
	plugins: [
		tanstackStart(),
		cloudflare({
			viteEnvironment: { name: "ssr" },
			auxiliaryWorkers: [{ configPath: "./wrangler.aux.jsonc" }],
		}),
	],
});
```

See the Vite plugin [API docs](/workers/vite-plugin/reference/api/) for more info.

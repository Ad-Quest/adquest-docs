DNS zone defaults are only applied at the moment a new zone is created and will not impact already existing zones, nor zones that existed previously and are being revived.

Any of the values specified as default can later be adjusted within each zone, on the respective [**DNS Settings**](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/dns/settings) or [**DNS Records**](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/dns/records) page.

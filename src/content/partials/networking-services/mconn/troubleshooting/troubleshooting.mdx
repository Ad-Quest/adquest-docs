## Device metrics

Cloudflare customers can inspect metrics for a specific {props.productName} in the Cloudflare dashboard. These metrics help you troubleshoot potential issues with your device. The information spans categories such as:

- Performance analytics
- Port analytics
- Event logs
- DHCP leasing information

To find the information above and start troubleshooting your {props.productName}:

<Render file="mconn/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-steps"	product="networking-services" params={{ productName: props.productName, dashName: props.dashName }} />

### Performance analytics

In Performance analytics you can review your {props.productName}'s performance over time including:

- Kernel boot time (how long it has been running and if it is activated or not)
- Last device snapshot (this also shows the frequency with which your device captures the snapshots that are used in several troubleshooting procedures)
- CPU temperature
- CPU load over time
- Used RAM over time

To access performance analytics:

<Render file="mconn/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-steps"	product="networking-services" params={{ productName: props.productName, dashName: props.dashName }} />
3. Select **Performance analytics**.

### Port analytics

Port analytics gives you access to information related to the packets sent and received through the ports in your {props.productName}. You can adjust the time range for the information displayed in the dashboard regarding to:

- Rate for packets sent and received
- Rate for data sent and received

The dashboard provides this information for all active ports in your {props.productName}. To access port analytics:

<Render file="mconn/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-steps"	product="networking-services" params={{ productName: props.productName, dashName: props.dashName }} />
3. Select **Port analytics**.

- `StartAttestation`: Started attestation to verify the integrity of Connector before allowing the device to connect to your account.
- `FinishAttestationSuccess`: Finished attestation successfully.
- `FinishAttestationFailure`: Failed attestation.
- `StartRotateCryptKey`: Started cryptography key rotation.
- `FinishRotateCryptKeySuccess`: Finished cryptography key rotation.
- `FinishRotateCryptKeyFailure`: Failed cryptography key rotation.
- `StartRotatePki`: Started public key infrastructure (PKI) rotation.
- `FinishRotatePkiSuccess`: Finished PKI rotation.
- `FinishRotatePkiFailure`: Failed PKI rotation.
- `StartUpgrade`: Began Connector's operating system upgrade.
- `FinishUpgradeSuccess`: Finished operating system upgrade.
- `FinishUpgradeFailure`: Failed operating system upgrade.
- `Reconcile`: Cloudflare is comparing the system's current state against its desired state.
- `ConfigureCloudflaredTunnel`: Configured Cloudflare Tunnel to debug device.

<Render file="mconn/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-steps"	product="networking-services" params={{ productName: props.productName, dashName: props.dashName }} />
3. Select **Events**.
4. You can filter results by specific events, and by time.

### DHCP leasing

## Troubleshooting tips

If you are experiencing difficulties with your {props.productName}, refer to the following tips to troubleshoot what might be happening.

## I have set up a site, but my {props.productName} is not working

Make sure that you have <a href={props.activateURL}>activated your {props.productName}</a>. Cloudflare ships the {props.productName} deactivated, and the it will only establish a connection to the Cloudflare network when it is activated.

## I have tried to activate {props.productName}, but it is still not working

Check if your {props.productName} is connected to the Internet via a port that can serve DHCP. This is required the first time a {props.productName} boots up so that it can reach the Cloudflare global network and download the required configurations that you set up in the Site configuration step. Refer to <a href={props.activateURL}>Activate Connector</a> for more details.

If you have a firewall deployed upstream of the {props.productName}, <a href={props.firewallURL}>check your firewall settings</a>. You might need to configure your firewall to allow traffic in specific ports for the {props.productName} to work properly.

## I can access {props.productName}'s health checks, but there is no traffic

If you have a firewall deployed upstream of the {props.productName}, make sure you review your <a href={props.firewallURL}>firewall settings</a>. You might need to configure your firewall to allow traffic in specific ports for the {props.productName} to work properly.

## Devices I have behind {props.productName} cannot connect to the Internet

If you have other routing appliances behind {props.productName}, make sure you create policy-based routing policies to send traffic from your devices through {props.productName}, instead of these other routing devices.

## How do I know if my device is contacting Cloudflare?

{props.productName} sends a heartbeat periodically to Cloudflare. You can <a href={props.heartbeatURL}>access the dashboard</a>, and check for the heartbeat status of your Connector device.

## What do I do in the event of hardware issues with {props.productName}?

Cloudflare is the single point of contact for any issues related to {props.productName}, including issues with hardware. When required, Cloudflare Support will work with our partner, TD Synnex, to resolve any issues with the physical device.

    title: Update on meeting join issues in firefox 144+
    description: |-
      In firefox 144+, users were not able to join the meetings, due to the browser's datachannel behavior change.

      Error: `x.data.arrayBuffer is not a function`

      Please upgrade to atleast `v1.2.0` to fix this. It is advised to periodically upgrade the SDKs.

:::note[Before you deploy]

Before deploying your tunnel, run [connectivity pre-checks](/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/troubleshoot-tunnels/connectivity-prechecks/) to validate that your environment can connect to Cloudflare Tunnel endpoints. These tests verify DNS resolution and network connectivity on port `7844`, helping you identify and resolve firewall or DNS issues before deployment. Running these checks sets your deployment up for success and helps narrow down the cause of any later connectivity issues.

You can upload objects to your bucket from using API (both [Workers Binding API](/r2/api/workers/workers-api-reference/) or [compatible S3 API](/r2/api/s3/api/)), rclone, Cloudflare dashboard, or Wrangler.

## Upload objects via Rclone

Rclone is a command-line tool which manages files on cloud storage. You can use rclone to upload objects to R2. Rclone is useful if you wish to upload multiple objects concurrently.

To use rclone, install it onto your machine using their official documentation - [Install rclone](https://rclone.org/install/).

Upload your files to R2 using the `rclone copy` command.

```sh
# Upload a single file
rclone copy /path/to/local/file.txt r2:bucket_name

# Upload everything in a directory
rclone copy /path/to/local/folder r2:bucket_name
```

Verify that your files have been uploaded by listing the objects stored in the destination R2 bucket using `rclone ls` command.

```sh
rclone ls r2:bucket_name
```

For more information, refer to our [rclone example](/r2/examples/rclone/).

## Upload objects via the Cloudflare dashboard

To upload objects to your bucket from the Cloudflare dashboard:

<Steps>
1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **R2 object storage** page.

   <DashButton url="/?to=/:account/r2/overview" />
2. Select your bucket.
3. Select **Upload**.
4. Choose to either drag and drop your file into the upload area or **select from computer**.
</Steps>

You will receive a confirmation message after a successful upload.

## Upload objects via Wrangler

:::note

Wrangler only supports uploading files up to 300 MiB in size. To upload large files, we recommend [rclone](/r2/examples/rclone/) or an [S3-compatible](/r2/api/s3/) tool of your choice.

:::

To upload a file to R2, call `put` and provide a name (key) for the object, as well as the path to the file via `--file`:

```sh
wrangler r2 object put test-bucket/dataset.csv --file=dataset.csv
```

```sh output
Creating object "dataset.csv" in bucket "test-bucket".
Upload complete.
```

You can set the `Content-Type` (MIME type), `Content-Disposition`, `Cache-Control` and other HTTP header metadata through optional flags.

You can upload multiple files by running the `bulk put` command with a JSON file that describes the files to upload.

The JSON file should be an array of objects, each containing a `key` and a `file` property. For example, create a file named `files-to-upload.json` with the following content:

```json
[
	{
		"key": "image1.png",
		"file": "/path/to/images/image1.png"
	},
	{
		"key": "image2.png",
		"file": "/path/to/images/image2.png"
	}
]
```

The path to the JSON list is passed via `--filename`:

```sh
wrangler r2 bulk put test-bucket --filename=files-to-upload.json
```

:::note
`r2 bulk put` does not currently support setting custom metadata for each object. All objects will be uploaded with the metadata passed via the command line.

Each object has a size limit of 300 MiB when using `r2 bulk put`, use `rclone` or other S3-compatible tools to upload larger files.

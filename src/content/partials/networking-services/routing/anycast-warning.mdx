:::caution[Anycast routing]
Cloudflare uses anycast to route traffic. Anycast is a network addressing and routing method that routes incoming requests to different locations. Traffic can arrive at a different geographic location than expected. Not all requests go to the closest data center because Internet routing and peering relationships are complex, and Cloudflare optimizes for performance and reliability.

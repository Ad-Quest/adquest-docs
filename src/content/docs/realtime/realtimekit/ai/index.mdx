|---------|-------------|
| [Transcription](/realtime/realtimekit/ai/transcription/) | Real-time and post-meeting speech-to-text |
| [Summary](/realtime/realtimekit/ai/summary/) | AI-generated meeting summaries |

## Quick start

Enable AI features when creating a meeting:

```json
{
  "title": "Team Standup",
  "ai_config": {
    "transcription": {
      "language": "en-US"
    },
    "summarization": {
      "summary_type": "team_meeting"
    }
  },
  "summarize_on_end": true
}
```

Ensure participants have `transcription_enabled: true` in their [preset](/realtime/realtimekit/concepts/preset/).

## Storage and retention

- Transcripts and summaries are stored for **7 days** from meeting start
- Files are stored in R2 with presigned URLs for secure access
- Delivered via [webhooks](/api/resources/realtime_kit/subresources/webhooks/) or REST API

import {

	Description,
	InlineBadge,
	Render,
	PackageManagers,
} from "~/components";

In this guide, you will create a new [TanStack Start](https://tanstack.com/start) application and deploy it to Cloudflare Workers (with the new [Workers Assets](/workers/static-assets/)).

## 1. Set up a new project

Start by cloning the Cloudflare example from the official TanStack repository.

<PackageManagers
	type="dlx"
	pkg="gitpick"
	args="TanStack/router/tree/main/examples/react/start-basic-cloudflare my-tanstack-app"
/>

After setting up your project, change your directory by running the following command:

```sh
cd my-tanstack-app
```

And install the project's dependencies with:

<PackageManagers type="install" />

## 2. Develop locally

After you have created your project, run the following command in the project directory to start a local development server. This will allow you to preview your project locally during development.

<PackageManagers type="run" args="dev" />

## 3. Deploy your Project

Your project can be deployed to a `*.workers.dev` subdomain or a [Custom Domain](/workers/configuration/routing/custom-domains/), from your own machine or from any CI/CD system, including [Cloudflare's own](/workers/ci-cd/builds/).

To deploy your application you will first need to build it:

<PackageManagers type="run" args="build" />

Once it's been built you can deploy it via:

<PackageManagers type="run" args="deploy" />

If you're using CI, ensure you update your ["deploy command"](/workers/ci-cd/builds/configuration/#build-settings) configuration appropriately.

:::note

After having built the application you can run the `preview` script to preview the built output locally before deploying it.
This can help you making sure that your application will work as intended once it's been deployed to the Cloudflare network:

<PackageManagers type="run" args="preview" />

## Bindings

Your TanStack Start application can be fully integrated with the Cloudflare Developer Platform, in both local development and in production, by using bindings.

You can use bindings simply by [importing the `env` object](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/#importing-env-as-a-global) and accessing it in your server
side code.

For example in the following way:

```tsx
import { createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { createServerFn } from "@tanstack/react-start";
import { env } from "cloudflare:workers";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/")({
	loader: () => getData(),
	component: RouteComponent,
});

const getData = createServerFn().handler(() => {
	// Use env here
});

function RouteComponent() {
	// ...
}
```

See `src/routes/index.tsx` for an example.

:::note

Running the `cf-typegen` script:

<PackageManagers type="run" args="cf-typegen" />

Will populate the `env` object with the various bindings based on your configuration.

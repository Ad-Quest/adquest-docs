You can now achieve higher cache hit ratios with [Generic Global Tiered Cache](/cache/how-to/tiered-cache/#generic-global-tiered-cache). Regional content hashing routes content consistently to the same upper-tier data centers, eliminating redundant caching and reducing origin load.

## How it works

Regional content hashing groups data centers by region and uses consistent hashing to route content to designated upper-tier caches:

- Same content always routes to the same upper-tier data center within a region.
- Eliminates redundant copies across multiple upper-tier caches.
- Increases the likelihood of cache HITs for the same content.

## Example

A popular image requested from multiple edge locations in a region:

- **Before**: Cached at 3-4 different upper-tier data centers
- **After**: Cached at 1 designated upper-tier data center
- **Result**: 3-4x fewer cache MISSes, reducing origin load and improving performance

## Get started

To get started, enable [Generic Global Tiered Cache](/cache/how-to/tiered-cache/#generic-global-tiered-cache) on your zone.

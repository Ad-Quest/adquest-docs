## Error 1201: Snippet tried to continue to origin multiple times

This error occurs when a Snippet attempts to call `fetch(request)` more than once.

### Resolution

Ensure that your Snippet code only calls `fetch(request)` once. This method is used to send the modified request to the origin server, and it should be called only once per Snippet to avoid conflicts.

## Error 1202: Snippets exceeded subrequests limit

This error occurs when the number of <GlossaryTooltip term="Snippets subrequest" prepend="A subrequest is ">subrequests</GlossaryTooltip> exceeds [the limit](/rules/snippets/#availability) for your Cloudflare plan.

### Resolution

Review your Snippet to ensure your code is within the <GlossaryTooltip term="Snippets subrequest" prepend="A subrequest is ">subrequest</GlossaryTooltip> [limits](/rules/snippets/#availability) for your plan. Each subrequest counts against your limit, including any redirects within a subrequest chain.

## Error 1203: Snippets exceeded CPU time limit

This error occurs when a Snippet exceeds the defined [CPU time limit](/rules/snippets/#limits) for Snippets.

### Resolution

Review your Snippet to ensure your code is within the CPU time limit. If you need a higher CPU time limit, consider using [Cloudflare Workers](/workers/). Refer to [When to use Snippets vs Workers](/rules/snippets/when-to-use/) for details.

## Error 1204: Snippets exceeded memory limit

This error occurs when a Snippet exceeds the defined [memory limit](/rules/snippets/#limits) for Snippets.

### Resolution

Review your Snippet to ensure your code is within the memory limit. If you need a higher memory limit, consider using [Cloudflare Workers](/workers/). Refer to [When to use Snippets vs Workers](/rules/snippets/when-to-use/) for details.

## Error 1205: Deployment in progress

A new Snippet was just deployed and is currently propagating across Cloudflare's global network. During this short window, requests may not be processed as expected.

### Resolution

This is a temporary issue. Retry your request after a few seconds — the Snippet will be active once propagation completes.

## Error 1206: Snippet threw exception

The Snippet encountered an unhandled JavaScript exception during execution. This may be caused by one of the following:

- Runtime JavaScript errors in Snippet code
- Unhandled promise rejections
- Type errors or reference errors

### Resolution

- Review the Snippet code to identify where the exception might have occurred and fix any detected bugs.
- Add proper error handling (try/catch blocks).

## Snippets cannot be renamed

The name you define when creating a Snippet will be used as the Snippet ID and cannot be edited afterwards.

### Resolution

To change the name of your Snippet, create a new Snippet and delete the old one.

## Other runtime errors

Snippets share some error codes with Workers, namely errors in the `11xx` range. For more information on these errors, refer to [Errors and exceptions](/workers/observability/errors/).

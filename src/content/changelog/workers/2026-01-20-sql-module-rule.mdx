The `.sql` file extension is now automatically configured to be importable in your Worker code when using [Wrangler](/workers/wrangler/bundling/#including-non-javascript-modules) or the [Cloudflare Vite plugin](/workers/vite-plugin/reference/non-javascript-modules/).
This is particular useful for importing migrations in Durable Objects and means you no longer need to configure custom rules when using [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/connect-cloudflare-do).

SQL files are imported as JavaScript strings:

```ts
// `example` will be a JavaScript string
import example from "./example.sql";
```

<Details header="Health check options">

- **Tunnel health checks**: Enabled by default. If you disable tunnel health checks, your tunnels appear 100% down in your <a href={props.tunnelHealthDash}>tunnel health dashboard</a> even when working. Cloudflare keeps sending traffic through the tunnel without the means to detect if the tunnel goes down. You must set up your own system to detect down tunnels, as Cloudflare cannot warn you about down tunnels. Refer to <a href={props.tunnelHealthChecksPage}>Tunnel health checks</a> for more information.
- **Health check rate**: If you keep tunnel health checks enabled, choose a <a href={props.updateHCFrequencyPage}>health check rate</a> for your tunnel. Available options are _Low_, _Medium_, and _High_.
- **Health check type**: Defaults to _Reply_ and to creating an ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) reply. If your firewall drops this type of packet because it assumes the packet is an attack, change this option to _Request_ which creates an ICMP request. Refer to <a href={props.tunnelHealthChecksPage}>Tunnel health checks</a> for more information.
- **Health check direction**: Defaults to **{props.biVsUniHealthCheck}** for {props.productName}. Refer to [Bidirectional vs unidirectional health checks](#bidirectional-vs-unidirectional-health-checks) for more details.
- **Health check target**: The customer end of the tunnel. This field is only visible when **Health check direction** is set to _Unidirectional_.

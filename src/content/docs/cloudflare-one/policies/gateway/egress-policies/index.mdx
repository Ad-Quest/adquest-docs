When your users connect to the Internet through Cloudflare Gateway, by default their traffic is assigned a source IP address that is shared across all Cloudflare WARP users. Enterprise users can purchase [dedicated egress IPs](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/egress-policies/dedicated-egress-ips/) to ensure that egress traffic from your organization is assigned a unique, static IP. These source IPs are dedicated to your account and can be used within allowlists on upstream services.

Egress policies allow you to control which dedicated egress IP is used and when, based on attributes such as identity, IP address, and geolocation. Traffic that does not match an egress policy will default to using the most performant dedicated egress IP.

Cloudflare does not publish WARP egress IP ranges. WARP egress IPs are not documented at [Cloudflare's IP Ranges](https://cloudflare.com/ips). To obtain a dedicated WARP egress IP, contact your account team.

<Render file="gateway/terraform-precedence-warning" product="cloudflare-one" />

## Load balancing

When using either the default Cloudflare egress IPs or any dedicated egress IPs, Gateway traffic that does not match an egress policy will egress from the closest Cloudflare data center with a default Gateway egress IP. If there are two data centers of equal distance from the user, Gateway will split the traffic between the two data centers, and the load balancer will retain the same user selection and egress IP regardless of data center.

## Force IP version

To control whether only IPv4 or IPv6 is used to egress, ensure you are [filtering DNS traffic](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/initial-setup/dns/), then create a DNS policy to [block AAAA or A records](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/dns-policies/common-policies/#control-ip-version).

## Example policies

The following egress policy configures all traffic destined for a third-party network to use a static source IP:

<Render
	file="gateway/policies/egress-destination-ip"
	product="cloudflare-one"
/>

### Catch-all policy

For the best performance, we recommend creating a catch-all policy to route all other users through the default Zero Trust IP range:

| Policy name           | Selector | Operator | Value                    | Egress method                    |
| --------------------- | -------- | -------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| Default egress policy | Protocol | in       | `All options (Protocol)` | Cloudflare default egress method |

Since Gateway policies evaluate from [top to bottom](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/order-of-enforcement/#order-of-precedence) in the UI, be sure to place the catch-all policy at the bottom of the list. If you do not include a catch-all policy, all other traffic will attempt to use the closest dedicated egress IP location. To control which egress IP Gateway uses, create an egress policy.

## Egress methods

Choose one of the following options for your egress policy:

- **Use default Cloudflare egress method** uses the default source IP range shared across all Zero Trust accounts. Ensures the most performant Internet experience as user traffic egresses from the nearest Cloudflare data center.

- **Use dedicated egress IPs (Cloudflare or BYOIP)** uses the primary IPv4 address and IPv6 range selected in the dropdown menus. You can optionally specify a secondary IPv4 address in a different data center. If the primary data center goes down, Gateway will egress from the secondary data center to avoid traffic drops during reroutes. There is no need for a secondary IPv6 because IPv6 traffic can egress from any Cloudflare data center. Dedicated egress IPs can be provided by either Cloudflare or [BYOIP](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/egress-policies/dedicated-egress-ips/#bring-your-own-ip-address-byoip). To learn more about IPv4 and IPv6 egress behavior, refer to [Egress locations](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/egress-policies/dedicated-egress-ips/#egress-location).

## Selectors

Gateway matches egress traffic against the following selectors, or criteria:

### Application <Badge text="Beta" variant="caution"/>

<Render
	file="gateway/selectors/application"
	product="cloudflare-one"
	params={{ policyType: "egress" }}
/>

/>

### Protocol

<Render file="gateway/selectors/protocol" product="cloudflare-one" />

### Proxy Endpoint

<Render file="gateway/selectors/proxy-endpoint" product="cloudflare-one" />

### Source Continent

The continent of the user making the request. <Render file="gateway/selectors/source-continent" product="cloudflare-one" params={{ one: "net.src" }} />

### Source Country

The country of the user making the request. <Render file="gateway/selectors/source-country" product="cloudflare-one" params={{ one: "net.src" }} />

### Source Internal IP

	product="cloudflare-one"
	params={{ one: "egress", two: "net.src.internal_src_ip" }}
/>

### Source IP

<Render

### Virtual Network

<Render

	product="cloudflare-one"
	params={{ one: "net.vnet_id" }}
/>

## Comparison operators

<Render file="gateway/comparison-operators" product="cloudflare-one" />

## Value

You can input a single value or use regular expressions to specify a range of values.

Gateway uses Rust to evaluate regular expressions. The Rust implementation is slightly different than regex libraries used elsewhere. To evaluate if your regex matches, you can use [Rustexp](https://rustexp.lpil.uk/).

## Logical operators

<Render
	file="gateway/logical-operators"
	product="cloudflare-one"
	params={{ one: "**Identity** or **Device Posture**" }}
/>

## Limitations

### Selector prerequisites

The [Application](#application), [Content Categories](#content-categories), [Domain](#domain), and [Host](#host) selectors are only available for traffic on-ramped to Gateway with the following methods:

<Render file="gateway/egress-selector-onramps" product="cloudflare-one" />

When you use these selectors in an egress policy for traffic from a supported on-ramp, Gateway will assign <GlossaryTooltip term="initial resolved IP">initial resolved IPs</GlossaryTooltip> to the DNS queries, then apply the correct egress IP according to the egress policy. Unsupported traffic will be resolved with your default Gateway settings. Gateway will only overwrite the DNS response when the query matches a condition in the egress policy. If you use [DNS locations](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/agentless/dns/locations/) to send a DNS query to Gateway with IPv4, IPv6, DoT, or DoH, Gateway will not return the initial resolved IP for supported traffic nor resolve unsupported traffic.

Gateway will overwrite the DNS response for all supported traffic, even if you use identity or device posture selectors to limit which users or devices are affected by the policy. In these cases, while the DNS response is overwritten, Gateway will still apply the correct egress policy.

To turn on the selectors for your account:

<Tabs syncKey="dashPlusAPI"> <TabItem label="Dashboard">

1. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/), go to **Settings** > **Network**.
2. In **Firewall**, turn on **Host selector**.

</TabItem> <TabItem label="API">

Use the [Patch Zero Trust account configuration](/api/resources/zero_trust/subresources/gateway/subresources/configurations/methods/edit/) endpoint to update your Zero Trust configuration. For example:

<APIRequest
	path="/accounts/{account_id}/gateway/configuration"
	method="PATCH"
	json={{
		settings: {
			host_selector: {
				enabled: true,
			},
		},
	}}
/>

</TabItem> </Tabs>

Additionally, to use these selectors to filter traffic onboarded with WARP, you need to:

1.  Ensure you have deployed [WARP version 2025.4.929.0](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/download-warp/) or later on your users' desktop devices. If you need to apply your policies to mobile devices or devices running a version of WARP prior to 2025.4.929.0, add and deploy the following key-value pair to your devices' [WARP configuration file](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/deployment/mdm-deployment/) (`mdm.xml` on Windows and Linux or `com.cloudflare.warp.plist` on macOS):

    ```diff lang="xml"
    <array>
    	<dict>
    +		<key>doh_in_tunnel</key>
    +		<true/>
    	</dict>
    </array>
    ```

2. <Render file="gateway/egress-selector-split-tunnels" product="cloudflare-one" />

The WARP client must be set to _Gateway with WARP_ mode for traffic affected by these selectors to route correctly.

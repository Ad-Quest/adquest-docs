Use the following workflow to deploy a custom ruleset:

1. [Create a custom ruleset](/ruleset-engine/custom-rulesets/create-custom-ruleset/), optionally providing a list of rules to include in the custom ruleset.
2. (Optional) [Add rules to your custom ruleset](/ruleset-engine/custom-rulesets/add-rules-ruleset/).
3. [Deploy the custom ruleset](/ruleset-engine/custom-rulesets/deploy-custom-ruleset/) by adding an `execute` rule to a phase entry point ruleset. If you skip this step, the rules of the custom ruleset will not run.

Currently, custom rulesets are only supported by the [Cloudflare WAF](/waf/), both at the account and the zone level.

:::note
You cannot execute a custom ruleset from another custom ruleset, only from an [entry point ruleset](/ruleset-engine/about/rulesets/#entry-point-ruleset).

## Change the behavior of a custom ruleset

To modify custom ruleset behavior, Cloudflare recommends [creating a new custom ruleset](/ruleset-engine/custom-rulesets/create-custom-ruleset/) or [editing the custom ruleset](/ruleset-engine/custom-rulesets/add-rules-ruleset/) instead of using overrides.

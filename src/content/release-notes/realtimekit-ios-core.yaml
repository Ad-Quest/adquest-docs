    title: RealtimeKit iOS Core 1.2.0
    description: |-
      **Breaking changes**
      
      - Rename `RtkLivestreamData.roomName` to `RtkLivestreamData.meetingId` to match existing API convention
      - Remove obsolete `WaitingRoomPermissions` abstraction — all the relevant functionality here is available through `HostPermissions`
      - VideoDevice gained a `cameraType: CameraType` parameter
      - `VideoDeviceType#displayName` is now deprecated, and it's recommended to call `VideoDevice#toString` instead to get user-facing names for individual `VideoDevice` instances
      - Existing APIs related to middlewares were removed and replaced with equivalent counterparts from WebRTC: `RtkSelfParticipant#addVideoMiddleware`, `RtkSelfParticipant#getVideoMiddlewares` and `RtkSelfParticipant#removeVideoMiddleware` have been removed. We do not support middlewares on iOS so these APIs were no-op and were incorrectly exposed.
      
      **Features**
      
      - Reimplement middlewares using WebRTC-native primitives to resolve intermittent crashes and other issues.
      - `VideoDevice` now properly labels multiple cameras based on their camera characteristics such as wide-angle and telephoto.

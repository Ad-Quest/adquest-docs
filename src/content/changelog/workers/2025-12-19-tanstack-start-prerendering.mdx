[TanStack Start](https://tanstack.com/start/) apps can now prerender routes to static HTML at build time with access to build time environment variables 
and bindings,  and serve them as [static assets](/workers/static-assets/). To enable prerendering, configure the `prerender` option of the TanStack Start plugin in your Vite config:

```ts title="vite.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import { cloudflare } from "@cloudflare/vite-plugin";
import { tanstackStart } from "@tanstack/react-start/plugin/vite";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    cloudflare({ viteEnvironment: { name: "ssr" } }),
    tanstackStart({
      prerender: {
        enabled: true,
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

This feature requires `@tanstack/react-start` v1.138.0 or later. See the [TanStack Start framework guide](/workers/framework-guides/web-apps/tanstack-start/#static-prerendering) for more details.

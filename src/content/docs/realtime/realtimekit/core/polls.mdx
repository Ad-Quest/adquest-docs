This guide explains how to create, vote on, and interact with polls in a meeting using Cloudflare RealtimeKit.

## Introduction

<Tabs syncKey="realtimeKitFrameworkTabs">
<TabItem label="Web Components">

The meetings polls object can be accessed using `meeting.polls`. It provides methods to create polls, vote, and more.

```js
console.log("Polls object:", meeting.polls);
```

The `meeting.polls.items` property returns an array of all polls created in a meeting, where each element is an object of type `Poll`.

```js
console.log("All polls:", meeting.polls.items);
```

### Poll Type

The `Poll` type is defined as follows:

```typescript
interface Poll {
	id: string;
	question: string;
	options: PollOption[];
	anonymous: boolean;
	hideVotes: boolean;
	createdBy: string;
	createdByUserId: string;
	voted: string[]; // stores participant ID
}

interface PollOption {
	text: string;
	votes: {
		id: string; // stores participant ID
		name: string;
	}[];
	count: number;
}
```

The meetings polls object can be accessed using `meeting.polls`. It provides methods to create polls, vote, and more.

```jsx
console.log("Polls object:", meeting.polls);
```

The `meeting.polls.items` property returns an array of all polls created in a meeting, where each element is an object of type `Poll`.

```jsx
console.log("All polls:", meeting.polls.items);
```

### Poll Type

The `Poll` type is defined as follows:

```typescript
interface Poll {
	id: string;
	question: string;
	options: PollOption[];
	anonymous: boolean;
	hideVotes: boolean;
	createdBy: string;
	createdByUserId: string;
	voted: string[]; // stores participant ID
}

interface PollOption {
	text: string;
	votes: {
		id: string; // stores participant ID
		name: string;
	}[];
	count: number;
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Android">

You can access the polls functionality in a meeting using the `meeting.polls` object. This object provides methods to create polls, vote, and perform other poll-related actions.

To retrieve all polls created during a meeting, use `meeting.polls.items`. This returns an array where each element is an object of type `com.cloudflare.realtimekit.polls.Poll`.

### Poll type

The `Poll` type represents a poll within a meeting:

```kotlin
class Poll(
  val id: String,
  val question: String,
  val anonymous: Boolean,
  val hideVotes: Boolean,
  val createdBy: String,
  val options: List<PollOption>,
  val voted: List<String>,
)
```

Each poll contains a list of `PollOption` objects, representing the available options for that poll.

Every `PollOption` includes a list of `PollVote` objects, where each vote contains the voter's `id` and `name`.

```kotlin
class PollOption(
  val text: String,
  val votes: List<PollVote>,
  val count: Int
)
```

```kotlin
class PollVote(
  val id: String,
  val name: String
)
```

### Listening to new polls in a meeting

To receive updates about new polls or poll changes during a meeting, implement the `RtkPollsEventListener` interface. Register your listener using `meeting.addPollsEventListener(rtkPollsEventListener)`.

The `onNewPoll()` method is called whenever a new poll is created in the meeting.

The `onPollUpdate()` method is invoked when a specific poll is updated, such as when participants vote or poll details change. The `onPollUpdates()` method is called when there are updates to the list of polls, including new polls being created or multiple polls being updated at once. Use these callbacks to keep your poll UI in sync with the latest poll data.

```kotlin
meeting.addPollsEventListener(object : RtkPollsEventListener {
    override fun onNewPoll(poll: Poll) {
    }

    override fun onPollUpdate(poll: Poll) {
    }

    override fun onPollUpdates(pollItems: List<Poll>) {
    }
  }
)
```

<TabItem label="iOS">

The meetings polls object can be accessed using `meeting.polls`. It provides methods to create polls, vote, and more.

`meeting.polls.items` returns an array of all polls created in a meeting, where each element is an object of type `Poll`.

### Poll type

The `Poll` type is defined as follows:

```swift
class Poll {
  let id: String
  let question: String
  let anonymous: Bool
  let hideVotes: Bool
  let createdBy: String
  let options: [PollOption]
  let voted: [String]
}
```

The type `Poll` is the main class for any poll in RealtimeKit. It also contains list of `PollOption` which are options for a given poll. And every `PollOption` has list of votes inside of it. Votes are objects of class `PollVote` which internally has id and name of the vote.

```swift
class PollOption {
  let text: String
  let votes: [PollVote]
  let count: Int
}

class PollVote {
  let id: String
  let name: String
}
```

### Listening to new polls in a meeting

To be able to receive new poll messages you need to implement a method `onPollUpdates()` method from callback `RtkPollsEventListener`. You can subscribe to this events by calling `meeting.addPollsEventListener(meetingViewModel)`

```swift
extension MeetingViewModel: RtkPollsEventListener {
  func onNewPoll(poll: Poll) {
    // code to handle new poll
  }

  func onPollUpdates(pollItems: [Poll]) {
    // code to handle polls and their vote updates.
  }

  func onPollUpdate(poll: Poll) {}
}
```

<TabItem label="Flutter">

The meetings polls object can be accessed using `meeting.polls`. It provides methods to create polls, vote, and more.

`meeting.polls.items` returns an array of all polls created in a meeting, where each element is an object of type `Poll`.

### Poll type

The `Poll` type is defined as follows:

```dart
class Poll {
  final String id;
  final String question;
  final bool anonymous;
  final bool hideVotes;
  final String createdBy;
  final List<PollOption> options;
  final List<String> voted;
}
```

The `Poll` class has the following properties:

- `id`: Unique ID assigned to each poll.
- `question`: Question of the poll.
- `anonymous`: To hide the votes of each user even after completion. (false by default)
- `hideVotes`: Hide votes until the voting is complete. (enabled if anonymous is enabled)
- `createdBy`: Name of creator the poll.
- `options`: Array of `PollOption` object, contains all the options to the poll question.
- `voted`: Array of String which contains User IDs that have voted.

The type `Poll` represents a poll in a RealtimeKit meeting. It also contains list of `PollOption` which are options for a given poll. And every `PollOption` has list of votes inside of it. Votes are objects of class `PollVote` which internally has id and name of the vote.

```dart
class PollOption(
  final String text;   // Option text.
  final List<PollVote> votes;   // List of votes.
  final int count;    // Number of votes.
);

class PollVote {
  final String id;    // ID of the voter.
  final String name;  // Name of the voter.
}
```

### Listening to new polls in a meeting

To be able to receive new poll messages you need to implement a method `onPollUpdates()` method from callback `RtkPollsEventListener`:

To get poll updates, listen to `onPollUpdates()` callback:

```dart
class PollEventsListener extends RtkPollsEventListener {
  @override
  void onPollUpdates(List<Poll> pollItems) {
    /// code to handle polls
  }

  @override
  void onNewPoll(Poll poll) {
    /// code to handle new poll
  }
}
```

You can subscribe to these events as follows:

```dart
meeting.addPollsEventListener(PollEventsListener());
```

The meetings polls object can be accessed using `meeting.polls`. It provides methods to create polls, vote, and more.

`meeting.polls.items` returns an array of all polls created in a meeting, where each element is an object of type `Poll`.

### Poll type

The `Poll` type is defined as follows:

```ts
interface Poll {
	id: string;
	question: string;
	options: PollOption[];
	anonymous: boolean;
	hideVotes: boolean;
	createdBy: string;
	createdByUserId: string;
	voted: string[]; // stores participant ID
}

interface PollOption {
	text: string;
	votes: {
		id: string; // stores participant ID
		name: string;
	}[];
	count: number;
}
```

### View Poll Results

The total votes on a poll can be accessed in the following manner:

```js
const poll = meeting.polls.items[0];
const votes = poll.voted;
```

`votes` is an array of participant IDs (`meeting.participant.id`).

The total votes on a poll option can be accessed in the following manner:

```js
const poll = meeting.polls.items[0];
const options = poll.options;
```

`options` returns an array of objects, where each object is of type `PollOption`.

### Get Notified When a Poll is Created or Updated

An event is fired each time `meeting.polls.items` is updated or created. You can listen for this to get the updated list of polls. The response object contains the following properties:

- `polls` - List of all polls
- `newPoll` - A boolean variable which is `true` when a new poll has been created

```js
meeting.polls.on("pollsUpdate", ({ polls, newPoll }) => {
	console.log("Polls updated:", polls);
	console.log("Is new poll:", newPoll);

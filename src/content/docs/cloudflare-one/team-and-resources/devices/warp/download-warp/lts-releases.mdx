Long-Term Support (LTS) releases are stable releases that are guaranteed to continue receiving security bug fixes for at least 12 months or 90 days after the next LTS release, whichever is greater.

:::note
No LTS releases are currently available, as Cloudflare is still rolling out our new LTS release process. When a stable release is declared an LTS release, it will be listed on this page and announced in the [WARP changelog](/cloudflare-one/changelog/warp/).

<TabItem label="Web Frameworks">

All Web Frameworks (Web Components, React, Angular) share the same error codes.

## RealtimeKitClient

#### Error code: 0001

- **Error message**: Failed to initialize
- **Possible reason**: RealtimeKitClient is not getting initialized.
- **Possible solution**: Verify if you initialized the RealtimeKitClient correctly `await RealtimeKitClient.init({ ... })`. See [RealtimeKitClient](https://docs.realtime.cloudflare.com/web-core/reference/RealtimeKitClient). If you continue to experience issues, please reach out to Cloudflare support.

#### Error code: 0002

- **Error message**: Failed to join room
- **Possible reason**: Indicates a problem with the RealtimeKitClient.
- **Possible solution**: The `join()` method is used to join a meeting room in RealtimeKit. Try calling this method again on the RealtimeKitClient:

```javascript
await meeting.join();
```

Once the join room process completes, you'll see the `roomJoined` event is emitted on the `meeting.self` namespace.

#### Error code: 0003

- **Error message**: Failed to leave room
- **Possible reason**: Indicates a problem with the RealtimeKitClient.
- **Possible solution**: The `leave()` method is used to leave a meeting room in RealtimeKit. Try calling this method again on the RealtimeKitClient:

```javascript
await meeting.leave();
```

#### Error code: 0004

- **Possible reason**: Indicates a problem with the passed participant auth token.

- **Error message**: HTTP Network Error
- **Possible reason**: Either internet issues are present or the API requests are failing due to a faulty auth token among other cases

#### Error code: 0012

- **Error message**: Websocket Network Error
- **Possible reason**: Either internet issues are present or the Websocket connection failed due to a faulty auth token among other cases

#### Error code: 0013

- **Error message**: Rate Limited
- **Possible reason**: SDK API that you are calling is being called too often

Remote captures allow administrators to collect packet captures (PCAPs) and WARP diagnostic logs directly from end user devices. This data can be used to troubleshoot network problems, investigate security incidents, and identify performance bottlenecks.

## Start a remote capture

<Render file="dex/pcaps-run" product="cloudflare-one" />

## Check remote capture status

To view a list of captures, go to **DEX** > **Remote captures**. The **Status** column displays one of the following options:

- **Success**: The capture is complete and ready for download. Any partially successful captures will still upload to Cloudflare. For example, there could be a scenario where the PCAP succeeds on the primary network interface but fails on the WARP tunnel interface. You can [review PCAP results](/cloudflare-one/insights/dex/remote-captures/#download-remote-captures) to determine which PCAPs succeeded or failed.
- **Running**: The capture is in progress on the device.
- **Pending Upload**: The capture is complete but not yet ready for download.
- **Failed**: The capture has either timed out or encountered an error. To retry the capture, check the WARP client version and [connectivity status](/cloudflare-one/insights/dex/monitoring/#fleet-status), then start a [new capture](/cloudflare-one/insights/dex/remote-captures/#start-a-remote-capture).

## Download remote captures

<Render file="dex/pcaps-download" product="cloudflare-one" />

### Device PCAP contents

The downloaded PCAP folder contains three files:

- `capture-default.pcap`: Packet captures for the primary network interface.
- `capture-tunnel.pcap`: Packet captures for traffic inside of the WARP tunnel.
- `results.json`: Reports successful and failed packet captures.

You can analyze `.pcap` files using Wireshark or another third-party packet capture tool.

### WARP Diag contents

Refer to [WARP diagnostic logs](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/troubleshooting/warp-logs/#warp-diag-logs) for a description of each file.

## Limitations

- Packet captures are subject to the following limits:

    | Limit Type     | Maximum Value  |
    |----------------|----------------|
    | Time limit     | 600 seconds    |
    | File size      | 50 MB          |
    | Packet size    | 1500 bytes     |

- WARP diagnostic logs have no file size limit, but files larger than 100 MB cannot be uploaded to Cloudflare and must be shared directly with the admin.

- Windows devices do not support concurrent remote captures. If you start a remote capture while another is in progress, the second capture will fail immediately.

- PCAPs will fail on Windows if you have another third-party packet capture tool (such as, Packet Monitor `pktmon`) running.

- On Windows, packet captures may fail on devices configured with a non-English language due to limitations with the underlying `PktMon` tool.

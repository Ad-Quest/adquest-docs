### When does a Durable Object incur duration charges?

A Durable Object incurs duration charges when it is actively executing JavaScript — either handling a request or running event handlers — or when it is idle but does not meet the [conditions for hibernation](/durable-objects/concepts/durable-object-lifecycle/). An idle Durable Object that qualifies for hibernation does not incur duration charges, even during the brief window before the runtime hibernates it.

Once an object has been evicted from memory, the next time it is needed, it will be recreated (calling the constructor again).

There are several factors that can prevent a Durable Object from hibernating and cause it to continue incurring duration charges.

### Does an empty table / SQLite database contribute to my storage?

Yes, although minimal. Empty tables can consume at least a few kilobytes, based on the number of columns (table width) in the table. An empty SQLite database consumes approximately 12 KB of storage.

### Does metadata stored in Durable Objects count towards my storage?

All writes to a SQLite-backed Durable Object stores nominal amounts of metadata in internal tables in the Durable Object, which counts towards your billable storage.

The metadata remains in the Durable Object until you call [`deleteAll()`](/durable-objects/api/sqlite-storage-api/#deleteall).

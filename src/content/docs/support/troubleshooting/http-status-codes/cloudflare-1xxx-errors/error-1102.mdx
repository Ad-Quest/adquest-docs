## Error 1102: Worker exceeded resource limits

This error indicates that a Cloudflare Worker has exceeded its CPU time limit or memory limit.

### Exceeded CPU time

A Cloudflare Worker exceeds a [CPU time limit](/workers/platform/limits/#cpu-time). CPU time is the time spent executing code (for example, loops, parsing JSON, etc). Time spent on network requests (fetching, responding) does not count towards CPU time.

#### Debugging

To identify CPU-intensive code:

1. Use [CPU profiling with DevTools](/workers/observability/dev-tools/cpu-usage/) locally to identify expensive operations.
2. Review [Workers Logs](/workers/observability/logs/workers-logs/) - CPU time is surfaced in the invocation log. This can help find if specific routes or requests are consuming high CPU time.

#### Resolution

Contact the developer of your Workers code to optimize code for a reduction in CPU usage. Common optimization strategies include:

- Reducing the number of iterations in loops
- Optimizing JSON parsing operations
- Caching computed values
- Breaking up large operations into smaller chunks

You can also [increase the CPU time limit](/workers/platform/limits/#cpu-time) on the Workers Paid plan up to 5 minutes for CPU-bound tasks.

### Exceeded memory

A Cloudflare Worker exceeds the [128 MB memory limit](/workers/platform/limits/#memory). This is a per-isolate limit, an isolate may be handling multiple requests concurrently.

#### Debugging

To identify memory issues:

1. Use [memory profiling with DevTools](/workers/observability/dev-tools/memory-usage/) locally to take memory snapshots and identify leaks.
2. Look for patterns like buffering a body which could be large (request or response), large objects stored in global scope or accumulating data in arrays.

#### Resolution

To avoid exceeding memory limits:

- Avoid buffering large objects or responses in memory
- Use streaming APIs such as [`TransformStream`](/workers/runtime-apis/streams/transformstream/) or [`node:stream`](/workers/runtime-apis/nodejs/streams/) to process data without buffering
- Avoid storing large objects in global scope
- Be cautious with operations that accumulate data (e.g., appending to strings or arrays repeatedly)

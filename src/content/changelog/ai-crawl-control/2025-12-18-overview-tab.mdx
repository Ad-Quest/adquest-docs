The **Overview** tab is now the default view in AI Crawl Control. The previous default view with controls for individual AI crawlers is available in the **Crawlers** tab.

## What's new

- **Executive summary** — Monitor total requests, volume change, most common status code, most popular path, and high-volume activity
- **Operator grouping** — Track crawlers by their operating companies (OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, ByteDance, Anthropic, Meta)
- **Customizable filters** — Filter your snapshot by date range, crawler, operator, hostname, or path

Producing a video is just the beginning. Videos are inherently harder to edit than text, making maintenance more complex. Even small changes often require re-recording, re-timing, or adjusting visuals. This makes it critical to ensure script accuracy and alignment with documentation from the start.

And since videos are harder to edit than text, ensuring script and visual accuracy upfront is critical. To keep videos up-to-date, we follow a simplified, two-pronged approach:

- **AI-Assisted Periodic Checks**: Upload videos to Gemini for automated checks against documentation and dashboard UI
Detect outdated workflows, UI elements, or inconsistencies

- **Internal Feedback & Updates**: Rely on product managers (PMs), subject matter experts (SMEs), and internal signals when UI or functionality changes
Update scripts, visuals, or narration as needed and re-upload the video

We are currently developing an internal tool for code-driven screen demos. When product code updates, the tool automatically updates video footage, minimizing manual re-recording and ensuring tutorials and demos reflect the latest product state.

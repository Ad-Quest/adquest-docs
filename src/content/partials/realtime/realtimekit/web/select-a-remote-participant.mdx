To perform actions on a specific participant, you first need to retrieve their participant object.
Remote participants (other participants) are available in `meeting.participants`. The local participant is available in `meeting.self`.
Refer to [Meeting Object Explained](/realtime/realtimekit/core/meeting-object-explained/) for details.

```ts
const joinedParticipants = meeting.participants.joined.toArray();
const participant = joinedParticipants[0];
if (!participant) {
	// No remote participants are currently joined.
}
```

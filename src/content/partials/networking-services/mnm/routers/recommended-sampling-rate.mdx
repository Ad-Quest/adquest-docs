Your router <GlossaryTooltip term="sampling">samples</GlossaryTooltip> the traffic that passes through it to create <GlossaryTooltip term="NetFlow">NetFlow</GlossaryTooltip> or <GlossaryTooltip term="sFlow">sFlow</GlossaryTooltip> data. Lower sampling rates increase network flow data accuracy but require more router memory and CPU to generate the data. Higher sampling rates maintain accuracy when your network receives a larger amount of traffic.

The table below provides general recommendations for sampling rates depending on your traffic volume. Test different sampling rates to find the best option for your network.

| Traffic Volume | Router sampling recommendation              |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Low            | Between 1 in 100 packets - 1 in 500 packets |
| Medium         | Between 1 in 1,000 - 1 in 2,000 packets     |
| High           | Between 1 in 2,000 - 1 in 4,000 packets     |

As a general rule, you may notice a loss in data accuracy (depending on your network volume) when your network flow sampling rate exceeds 1 in 5,000 packets.

You may receive the error message "Your account is limited to 2 payment methods, and you've reached that limit. Please remove an existing payment method before adding a new one." when trying to add additional methods.

If you are unable to add or edit a payment method, [delete a payment method](/billing/update-billing-info/#delete-a-payment-method) and try again.

You can now programmatically override Cache Rules using the `cf` object in the `fetch()` command. This feature gives you fine-grained control over caching behavior on a per-request basis, allowing Workers to customize cache settings dynamically based on request properties, user context, or business logic.

## How it works

Using the `cf` object in `fetch()`, you can override specific Cache Rules settings by:

1. **Setting custom cache options**: Pass cache properties in the `cf` object as the second argument to `fetch()` to override default Cache Rules.
2. **Dynamic cache control**: Apply different caching strategies based on request headers, cookies, or other runtime conditions.
3. **Per-request customization**: Bypass or modify Cache Rules for individual requests while maintaining default behavior for others.
4. **Programmatic cache management**: Implement complex caching logic that adapts to your application's needs.

## What can be configured

Workers can override the following Cache Rules settings through the `cf` object:

- **`cacheEverything`**: Treat all content as static and cache all file types beyond the default cached content.
- **`cacheTtl`**: Set custom time-to-live values in seconds for cached content at the edge, regardless of origin headers.
- **`cacheTtlByStatus`**: Set different TTLs based on the response status code (for example, `{ "200-299": 86400, 404: 1, "500-599": 0 }`).
- **`cacheKey`**: Customize cache keys to control which requests are treated as the same for caching purposes (Enterprise only).
- **`cacheTags`**: Append additional cache tags for targeted cache purging operations.

## Benefits

- **Enhanced flexibility**: Customize cache behavior without modifying zone-level Cache Rules.
- **Dynamic optimization**: Adjust caching strategies in real-time based on request context.
- **Simplified configuration**: Reduce the number of Cache Rules needed by handling edge cases programmatically.
- **Improved performance**: Fine-tune cache behavior for specific use cases to maximize hit rates.

## Get started

To get started, refer to the [Workers Fetch API documentation](/workers/runtime-apis/fetch/) and the [cf object properties documentation](/workers/runtime-apis/request/#the-cf-property-requestinitcfproperties).

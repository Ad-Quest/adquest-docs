:::caution[Deprecation notice]
Mirage was deprecated on September 15, 2025 and is no longer available.

As an alternative, Cloudflare recommends using [lazy loading](/images/tutorials/optimize-mobile-viewing/) and [responsive images](/images/transform-images/make-responsive-images/) to optimize image performance for all devices.
:::

## What was Mirage?

Cloudflare Mirage was a mobile image optimization feature that reduced bandwidth usage and accelerated image loading on slow mobile connections and HTTP/1.

Mirage worked by:

- Replacing images with low-resolution thumbnails bundled together into one file.
- Acting as a lazy loader, deferring loading of higher-resolution images until they become visible.

## Why was it deprecated?

Modern web standards and browser capabilities have evolved to provide native support for many of Mirage's features:

- Native lazy loading with the `loading="lazy"` HTML attribute.
- Responsive images using `srcset` and `<picture>` elements.
- HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 providing better performance.
- Improved mobile networks reducing the need for aggressive optimization.

## Migration path

Instead of Mirage, use:

- **[Polish](/images/polish/)** - Seamlessly optimizes images for all browsers, not only mobile, and keeps images at full resolution.
- **[Image Resizing](/images/transform-images/)** - Combined with `loading="lazy"` and `srcset` HTML attributes, provides modern responsive image delivery.
- **[Lazy loading guide](/images/tutorials/optimize-mobile-viewing/)** - Learn how to implement native lazy loading.
- **[Responsive images guide](/images/transform-images/make-responsive-images/)** - Create images that adapt to different devices.

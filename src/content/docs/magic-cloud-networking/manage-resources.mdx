## Cloud resource catalog

Your cloud environment is built from individual cloud resources, like virtual private clouds (VPCs), subnets, virtual machines (VMs), route tables, and routes. Magic Cloud Networking (beta) discovers all of your cloud resources and stores their configuration and status in the Cloud resource catalog, a read-only snapshot of your cloud environment. Discovery runs regularly in the background, keeping your catalog up to date as your environment changes.

When Magic Cloud Networking creates or modifies configurations in the cloud provider - for example, to deploy a managed IPsec on-ramp for Magic WAN - the created resources will be labeled as **Managed** in the resource catalog.

To browse the resources in your catalog:

1. Go to the **Connectors** page.

	<DashButton url="/?to=/:account/magic-networks/connections/tunnels" />

2. Select the **Cloud (beta)** tab.
3. In **Cloud resources**, select a resource to inspect its details.

## Edit Cloud integrations

You can change which cloud account the integration is linked to or delete the integration.

1. Go to **Cloud integrations**.

	<DashButton url="/?to=/:account/mcn/integrations" />

2. Select the integration you want to edit > **Edit**.
3. In **Linked account details**, select **Link integration to a different cloud account**.
4. Select **Save** when you are finished.
5. (Optional) You can also select **Delete** to delete your cloud integration.

## Download cloud resource catalog

You can download a JSON file containing metadata and configuration for all your cloud resources:

1. Go to the **Connectors** page.

	<DashButton url="/?to=/:account/magic-networks/connections/tunnels" />

2. Select the **Cloud (beta)** tab.
3. In **Cloud resources**, select **Download catalog**.

After your browser finishes downloading the ZIP file, expand it to access the JSON with the information about your cloud resources.

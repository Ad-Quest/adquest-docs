const breakoutRooms = await meeting.connectedMeetings.createMeetings([
  { title: "Breakout Room 1" },
  { title: "Breakout Room 2" },
  { title: "Breakout Room 3" },
]);

console.log("Created Breakout Rooms: ", breakoutRooms.map((room) => "Id:: " + room.id + " --- Title:: " + room.title).join("\n"));
```

`breakoutRooms` is an array of basic meeting information such as id and title. You can use the `id` of these objects to move participants to the breakout room.
